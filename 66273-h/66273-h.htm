</div>

<p>All the stories in this book have been tested
with children. Favorites easily available in other
collections have been omitted.</p>

<p>The seventy-five or more very short stories,
intended to help young children to express their
observations, experiences, and fancies, have been
included at the request of many teachers.</p>

<p>The writer hopes that by providing the busy
teacher with “tellable” stories, she may help to
win for story-telling the dignity of established
scholastic place.</p>

<p>The school is joining hands with the children for
fuller recognition of the story and story-telling.</p>

<p>Note, by the way, that it is with the children. In
an elder day grown-ups, too, yielded themselves to
the witchery of the story. But printing and the
book banished the wandering story-teller; with a
little progress in science came recoil from the superstitions
and absurdities of the folk tale; the increasing
complexity of life bred in the superficial thinker
contempt for the unperplexed nursery fable; the
intellectual pedant found it distressingly naïve;
pressure of affairs robbed the busy man of any
leisure for it. So, among peoples advancing in civilization,
the grown-ups gradually left the story more
and more to the children. And the children, wise
youngsters that they are, have never allowed themselves
to outgrow it.</p>

<p>Is it not delightful to note that learning is bringing
the adult back to the story? The trend of
thought to-day, urging him to look to the natural
beginnings of things, is taking him back to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
story. The historian searches it for early glimpses
of fact; the philosopher sees lasting wisdom in it;
the literary seer marvels at the truth and beauty of
fairy-tale symbols of life; the busy man of affairs
accompanies his children to juvenile drama and
nonsense opera. The art of story-telling itself is
again finding an audience among men and women,
as well as children. Best of all, the school, directing
its effort toward the natural development of the
young child, is pressing the educational properties
of the story.</p>

<p>Reiteration of these properties now is timely.
Psychology is throwing clearer light on the education
of the feelings and the taste; the story should
be helpful here. The thoughtful in the community
are urging more attention to the spiritualizing and
humanizing subjects in the courses of study; the
story belongs in this class. Other favorable present
conditions will appear as the merits of the story are
briefly set forth.</p>

<p>The story and story-telling will</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) <i>Give pleasure.</i></p>

<p>(2) <i>Stir and direct the imagination.</i></p>

<p>(3) <i>Arouse and direct the feelings.</i></p>

<p>(4) <i>Cultivate the taste.</i></p>

<p>(5) <i>Help to shape thought and language
mode.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>(6) <i>Stimulate and direct potential literary
creativity.</i></p>

<p>(7) <i>Serve as foreword for book-study of
literature.</i></p>

<p>(8) <i>Give knowledge of life.</i></p>

</div>

<p>(1) <i>The story will give pleasure.</i> Educational
thought is growing more and more cordial toward
this value. Undisturbed by any charge of “soft
pedagogy,” it finds wholesome pleasure, not merely
relaxing, but constructive, building toward physical
health, mental brightness, and moral virtue. Here
is the story’s opportunity. Every one admits it is
pleasure-giving. The stern-minded among us must
realize that this is its deepest educational value. It
is from the good pleasure the child gets from the
story that will ripen good taste, good will, good
effort, and all the other goods some teachers and
parents regard as more substantial merit. Besides,
joy appears to be here to stay. To attempt to take
it out of the plan of things is, to say the least, short-sighted.
American civilization is looking hopefully
to the school for better national standards of
pleasure. The school is under obligation to educate
the children to enjoyment of wholesome pleasure.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The story will stir and direct the imagination.</i>
We do not yet grant in practice the importance
of the imagination. We do not purposefully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
exercise it, as we do, for example, the reason. We
say glibly that imagination is at the root of the
successful man’s arrival at material profit, of the
explorer’s discovery and the practical scientist’s
invention, of the poet’s song and the philanthropist’s
vision of a state of society in which the kingdom
of heaven will be nearer at hand; but we
give little or no training to the imagination. Here
again is the story’s opportunity. Through the story
the interpretative story-teller may give the imagination
consistent exercise.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The story will arouse and direct the pupil’s
feelings.</i> The school to-day is emphasizing the
necessity of educating the heart, the climactic third
of the three great H’s,—the Head, the Hand, and
the Heart. And psychologists are telling us that
to educate a child to be kind, unselfish, filial, reverent,
gentle, courageous, good-tempered, to educate
him to admire goodness, justice, valor, to be sensible
of beauty, to aspire and make effort toward
excellence, is as practicable as to train him to do
or to make something. It calls for more delicate
but not different treatment; working not by dictation,
but by magnetic suggestion. The story-teller
may render a great service to the individual
and to the community by helping to form right
feeling-habit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>(4) <i>The well-chosen story will cultivate the
taste.</i> Psychology is urging early direction also
of the æsthetic sense. The story-teller, through her
own joyous response to beauty, has it in her power
to awaken and direct the children’s appreciation of
beauty. It is she, too, who must help to lay the
foundation for that better taste in novel or play
that America eagerly desires, and that publisher
and playwright say they stand ready to satisfy as
soon as the public arrives at it.</p>

<p>(5) <i>The story will help to form the child’s
thought and language habit.</i> As this is the value
most often acknowledged in classroom practice—though
not always by the best methods—it is not
necessary to do more at this point than restate it.
Mastery in thought and language is far-reaching
usefulness, affecting individual growth and social
harmony. The story, because of its easy, more or
less artless composition and graphic diction, lends
itself to starting right thought and language mode.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Story-telling may help to stimulate and
direct potential literary creativity.</i> In spite of its
breadth of view the school appears insensible to
the rights of children born creative. The array of
geniuses recently marshaled by a Chicago professor,
that teachers pronounced hopeless dunces
and in some cases drove from their classes, should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
set the school thinking. It is reaching out helpful
hands to the little unfortunate ones, the blind and
the deaf and the sick; but it continues to dismiss
the divinely commissioned little sister or brother,
with the platitude that his genius will survive if it
be sufficiently sturdy. This is a specious half-truth
unworthy of repetition. It is, besides, discrimination
against the individual. The school is
not meeting its obligation to <i>all</i> the children of the
community. It will not do to lay the blame to
the community’s “commercialized” standards. In
spite of apparent emphasis on the useful arts, the
community would not lose from the varied web
of its civilization the bright thread of painting and
music and story. Maturing thought is convincing
it that the fine arts are finely utilitarian. Here,
again, is the story’s opportunity. The simple materials
and childlike fancy in it may stimulate gradually
and naturally play of the creative imagination.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Story-telling should be at least foreword for
book-study of literature.</i> The thoughtful teacher
of literature to-day finds in the classic story all the
elements of her material, and sees in the child listening
to it the most promising student of literature.
At the freely sympathetic period the child becomes
familiar with the inner life of language as used to
represent fundamental motive, character, and action.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
This is precisely the kind of knowledge that
he should bring as basis for study of more advanced
literature. The printed page will be informed
with lively meaning, to which his imagination,
feeling, and æsthetic sense can respond.
It is largely the school’s neglect of oral foundation
in literature, which, by the way, should not be
confined to the lowest grades, that is at the root of
feeble appreciation in book-study of literature.</p>

<p>(8) The story holds in it a greater value, as
much greater as life is than literature; <i>it will give
knowledge of life</i>. The writer might have said experience
of life, because of the child’s strong tendency
to be and to do what attracts him. Students
of literature, to-day, are urging that it is not a mere
“polishing” study, but the substantially useful subject
from which we may get clear and inspiring
knowledge of life. They would have literature
recognized as the reflection of life, idealized, it
may be, but therefore stronger reflection. As life
is the occupation that all of us, no matter what
our special vocation may be, must engage in together,
a study that throws light on it is indispensable.
Here is a great opportunity for the story.
Every genuine story, sense or nonsense, is a glimpse
of life, which will early give guiding knowledge and
experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>The story-teller cannot, by the way, afford to
ignore the evil in life. You may have read the
story of Kipling’s “kid”; how the parents in
fond but foolish love for their only son shut away
from him all knowledge that evil has come into the
world, and how the son, grown to manhood, enters
army life, where he meets his first temptation and
falls. The moral of the tale is obvious. Though it
is wise to keep in the wake of their experience with
evil, the story should help to provide the children
with knowledge and modes of conduct for the
situations of real life. The cunning story-teller,
presenting this or that bit of life, from which he
has not made the mistake of taking out the evil
already within the child’s experience or presently
to be met, touches the child into recoil from evil
and into admiration and imitation of the triumphant
way of virtue.</p>

<p>The story should, however, oftener engage children’s
attention with good, rather than evil, as the
central, active force in life. And the story told to
the growing boy or girl, and to the youth, should
prompt him to fine and finer endeavor. It is a
fatal error to assume that teachers and parents
cannot help to raise the community’s standards,
that the best the rising generation may carry out
from home and school is negative prudence, readiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
to accept questionable social practices and
ideals, that they themselves may achieve worldly
success. If each generation does not leave the
world a little better for its part in it, it has lived in
vain, and its “guides, philosophers, and friends,”
the parents and teachers of it, have denied their
office. The story helping toward this kind of constructivity
should lead. It is to the habit formed
in its children that society must look for higher
standards of living.</p>

<p>The story will widen the child’s outlook on life.
On the wings of the word the listener may fly away
to the uttermost bounds of the earth. In the story
world he, if poor, may be rich; if sad, merry; if
inarticulate, he may find expression.</p>

<p>Though it is not exhaustive, this is an imposing
array of reasons for admitting the story to unquestioned
educational dignity. If the school feel
the need of broad, scholarly precedent, it may find
it in the work or in the recorded opinions of such
seers as the Lambs, Longfellow, Carroll, Hawthorne,
Scott, Stevenson, Browning, Ruskin, Froebel,
Emerson. As yet story-telling is largely left
optional with the teacher. Should it not be made
a delightful school requirement? It addresses itself,
it is true, mainly to the æsthetic taste and the
feelings, it does not guarantee consequent action.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
But give it place early enough, and, if it must bring
it, the other good effect will be added unto it.</p>

<p>The best reason for admitting the story to scholastic
dignity still remains the best, its lasting
charm for the children.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Kinds of Stories to Tell</span></h3>

<p>We appear to be coming to the agreement that
we should tell the children many of the old, old
stories and some of the new, many stories from the
world of the imagination, some from the real
world; stories that will aid them in interpreting
their world, themselves, other children, some
grown-ups, nature; stories that will direct aright
the imagination, the sympathies, and the taste;
playful stories and more serious, sensible and nonsensical;
short stories and longer; stories to be
told over and over again, stories to be told in passing.
To meet the child’s and later the girl’s and
boy’s changing tastes and interests, and the needs
of their developing imagination and sympathies, our
choice should embrace, besides a great many others
that as yet have eluded classification, fairy tales,
fables, myths, legends, romances, tales of adventure,
stories of animal life, child life, growing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
boy and girl life, stories of great men and
women.</p>

<p>Some teachers find it hard to see any educational
value in play-stories like “The Three Bears,” nonsense
stories like “Chicken-Licken,” and drolls, or
farce “funny” stories like “Lazy Jack.” They do
not get the child’s point of view. They are disturbed
by the apparently idle pleasure or extravagance
of them. “Chicken-Licken” appears to be
nothing but driveling nonsense. The writer has
no desire to attempt to turn it into sense nor to
press unduly the claim of this particular type of
story. But why not let it in as a nonsense tale, an
opportunity for giving the mind a frolic? This is
advanced by some students of the tale as its possible
origin. It may be thought of as a reflection in
literature of the naïveté of childhood; it catches
capitally its guilelessness in motive, social intercourse,
and deed. Its form also is childlike. The
child ekes out invention in the manner of the tale,
by the open artifice of cumulation and repetition.
Or the story may be dignified into literary introduction
to that type of classic which records the
very common human situation, “much ado about
nothing.”</p>

<p>The same teachers are disturbed also by the ethical
code of many of the folk tales; they find it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
crude and fleshly. It deals in large and sense-delighting
rewards. But may it not be possible that
the child must be allowed time to grow to a more
discriminating standard of conduct and a finer kind
of satisfaction?</p>

<p>It is to be hoped, however, that even then the
child will retain his capacity for laughing at merry
play and hearty comedy. Laughter is good for the
world. It is a tonic to the emotions, and regeneration
to the spirit, spurring it to fresh and better
effort; it is a sign, too, of broadening imagination
and sympathy. The man that has no laughter in
him is like Shakespeare’s man that has no music in
him, “fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils. Let
no such man be trusted.” Most stories will give
the children a more reserved pleasure, happy mental
and æsthetic satisfaction; some a fine gladness and
exaltation. But let us not be too narrow to admit
the wholesomely “funny” story.</p>

<p>The over-strained, anæmic, goody-good story is
likely to breed up a generation of canting hypocrites.
The little child is much occupied, it is true, with the
task of being good, and he is a great admirer of the
good people in the stories. There is room in children’s
literature for the rather obviously moral
tale, if it be not too often presented and if it be
really charming. From this point of view, Constance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
D’Arcy Mackay’s book of plays called “The
House of the Heart and Other Tales” is a suggestive
contribution to children’s drama.</p>

<p>For the younger children the story with plenty
of action, often with animals as characters, and
with happy ending has proved best. The story with
less joyous “inevitable ending” is, however, not to
be excluded; life is not to be distorted. Besides,
not all sad-ending stories are negative in effect,
leaving the child knowing only “what not to do”
rather than “what to do.” A story like Hans
Andersen’s “Daisy,” for example, induces constructive
inference and effect.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Principles of the Art of Telling Stories</span></h3>

<p>Story-telling is one of the most spontaneous of
the social arts. Yet it is an art, governed by at least
partially discerned principles. Analysis of them
will be helpful to the story-teller, but only in so far
as he grasps the fundamental principle that story
telling among the speech arts, like wood-carving
among the manual arts, indeed, even to a greater
degree, must be kept what it is by nature, apparently
without art, naïve and unelaborate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Getting the Story</span></h3>

<div class="smaller">

<p>The story-teller must wholly take into himself the life of which
he speaks, must let it live and operate in himself freely.</p>

<p class="right">—<span class="smcap">Froebel.</span></p>

</div>

<p>The story-teller must himself possess the story
before attempting to give it to another. This sounds
obvious, but it is not granted in practice. Much
poor schoolroom story-telling is evidently “unprepared.”
People born with a natural turn for
story-telling, and those who in their childhood
heard real story-telling, need to make less preparation
than others; but all story-tellers need to make
preparation. Much of the story-telling masquerading
as such is quackery, showing neither genius nor
study. Even in the very early days when formal
instruction in story-telling was unknown, the wandering
story-teller watched constantly to make his
performance tell, modifying his method in the light
of its effect upon his hearers. Later on, in the
Middle Ages, the court story-teller was professionally
trained (and also handsomely remunerated and
given the place of honor at the banquet). Intellectual
study of the story will not, by the way, destroy
spontaneity. It may dash it temporarily.
Coleridge tells us that his professor in poetics did
not hesitate to subject to the scrutiny of the microscope
the most delicate flowers and fruits of fancy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
(English in the schools has suffered from the results,
in its teachers, of the “literary affectation,” which
condemns attempt at definite English scholarship.)
Let us give all outlet possible to natural ability, and
to the inspiration of time and audience; but let us
not neglect the forethought of preparation. Shakespeare
did not, Sir Henry Irving did not, Duse
does not. Some teachers fall back on reading the
story; this has its own place, but it cannot take the
place of telling. The belief that story-telling should
be studied is gaining ground in a most convincing
quarter, the home. The office of motherhood is
deeply associated with things done instinctively
right; but the mother herself at mothers’ clubs and
elsewhere is seeking instruction in this chief
mother art.</p>

<p>To get the story, relax your imagination and
sympathy and let them go out to it. Sit down with
it and read and re-read it, or listen to it, and brood
upon it until you absorb its life, until you think and
feel and move in its being. Conjure up its scene
and people and happening.</p>

<p>Some may find imagining difficult. Perhaps it
was neglected in their training. Let them not be
discouraged; each succeeding attempt to realize
scene and person and action will make the task
easier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>You may, by the way, study the story in either of
two places: a lovely natural spot, where under the
lure of century-wisdomed tree, or amid sweet smells,
or flash of birds, or beckonings of shadows, you
may catch the glamour of the old-world setting in
the stories; or in a city street swarming with children,
old-faced before their time. The environment
in the second studio, far from destroying your
effort to grasp the wonder-world of the story, will
make special appeal to you. Here you will feel
divine compulsion to make child life more abundant:
to bring from story land bright hosts of gay
fairies and gentle children and brave knights and
real as well as fiction heroes as saving company
for the little worldlings, to make them chuckle with
a child’s hearty glee at trick of goblin or sprite, or
quake with delicious tremor at the tread of the
terrible giant. You will find that the “toughest,”
most crabbed city urchin will succumb to the witchery
of the fairy folk, to the charm of beauty and
the fair play of kindness and honesty.</p>

<p>The child’s world reflected in the story is the
right of the child in the city tenement district, and
society’s hope for him. It is, by the way, no less
the right of the rich child and no less society’s hope
for him.</p>

<p>After you have let the story take possession of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
you, take possession of it. To take possession of
the story,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) <i>Seek its spirit and intention.</i></p>

<p>(2) <i>Grasp its elements; its setting, its action,
its characters.</i></p>

<p>(3) <i>Master its workmanship, or its composition
and style.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Its spirit and intention.</i> Students of folklore
hesitate to impose on the folk tales ethical or æsthetical
motive; but they would not object to our seeing
in them, in addition to certain primitive ideas,
this or that playful fancy or more serious reflection
of life; in “The Elves and the Shoemaker,”
for example, hearty testimony to the worth of
honest effort, the record raised to some degree of
æsthetic merit by the charm of elfin appreciation;
in “Star Dollars,” crude sketch of childlike goodness
and faith, the picture touched into beauty by
the benediction of heaven; lovely symbol of gentle
living, like “Diamonds and Toads”; sweet blossom
of immortal beauty and goodness blighted by
the withering poison of envy, yet triumphantly
blooming, like “Snow White;” simple appreciation
of kindness of heart, like the “Hut in the
Wood;” idyl of the beauty and integrity of goodness,
like “Beauty and the Beast;” in “The
Straw, the Coal, and the Bean,” naïve history of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
merry-tragic situation; in “The Wolf and the
Seven Kids,” the happy triumph of mother wit
sharpened by love. For the children they, as well
as the more modern tales, must be kept direct,
simple stories. But the student need not miss a
broader significance. He can hardly fail to appreciate
the analogies to human conduct so often implied
in Hans Andersen’s tales, done, as in Dante’s
great tale, with conscious intent. He must not,
however, ask the children to probe for hidden
meanings, and he must not strain at suggesting
them in his interpretation. The story is not to be
turned into an abstraction; its concreteness is the
secret of its power to please and to move.</p>

<p>After you have thus characterized the story to
yourself, grasp its elements: its setting, or time
and place; its action; its persons, or characters.
And cultivate sensibility to their appropriateness.</p>

<p><i>The setting.</i> The lovely fairy romances, old and
new, like “The Frog Prince,” “Cinderella,” Andersen’s
“Princess on the Pea,” occurred in the all-possible
“once upon a time,” or in that delectable
bygone when “wishing was having,” or in such
right good kingly times as Arthur’s or Charlemagne’s.
Sometimes the place was an enchanted
castle shut away behind a hedge of thorns and
trees, in the very heart of a forest, a hedge that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
sprang up in a quarter of an hour, with thorns long
enough to impale unworthy suitors; sometimes it
was the highroad out to the world, upon which
many a stout hero set foot to seek fortune. The
merry gallant history of “Tom Thumb,” fairy
fledgeling, wizard-fostered, king’s jester and doughty
knightling, is referred to the magical days of Merlin
and the chivalrous court of Arthur. We find him,
too, versatile little imp, in his mother’s practical
pudding bowl, in the red cow’s mouth, in a giant’s
stomach, inside a fish; and each place is capital setting
for him. Who says that giants are figments of
the imagination? The people of Cornwall record
that it was in their land that Jack killed the giant,
and they point out a castle built on a rock standing
in the sea as the stronghold of the monster. (Let
the folklorists find in this primitive belief, if they
will; let us find, also, artistic fitness.) What a delightful
plausibility the tale takes on from this
minutely recorded geographical setting, as delightful
in its way as the vague long ago and dim place
of other tales! Here, in the apparently artless tale,
is the artistic device by which Defoe hoodwinked
the England of his day into believing that Robinson
Crusoe was fact and not truer fiction.</p>

<p>Note the appropriateness in change of scene;
Andersen’s “Ugly Duckling,” among the modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
tales, affords a good study. The artistic principle
is applied more naïvely in the old story of “The
Hut in the Wood” at the transformation of the hut
into a castle to be fit setting for the sovereign power
and beauty of kindness; also in “Mother Holle,”
at the emergence of the child from the dark well and
darker despair into the lovely meadow where the
sun was shining, and thousands of flowers were
blooming, and wonderful little ovens and red apple-trees
called out to her, and golden shower fell on her
and glorified her. In “Dummling,” at the stage
when enchantment is brought in, the scene changes
completely to a stone castle in whose courtyard are
stalls containing stone horses.</p>

<p>Note the narrative use made of setting. The
appearance of the sea, in “The Fisherman and his
Wife,” as the fisherman carries each succeeding
wish of his wife to the flounder, does as much to tell
the story as the action itself.</p>

<p>Setting, then, is part of the whole. It is not to be
overdone, nor is any part in the simple story, but
its appropriateness is worth appreciation.</p>

<p><i>The action.</i> The action is of course the chief
part of the story. The motive of the action is easy
to find. But again note that it is faithful to life
and that it paves the way for appreciation of the
motives of greater literature. In the simple tales,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
as in the novel and the drama, the action arises from
love, hate, envy, spirit of adventure, friendship,
malice, spirit of fun and play. Grasp the details of
the action. In some versions of “The Frog
Prince” the falling of the princess’s golden ball
into the well is made the occasion for the appearance
of the magical frog, which, for the aid he
offers, imposes the condition of companionship and
love. The princess pretends agreement. Her repugnance
to the frog becomes the complicating
force. And (in some tales) her father’s insistence
that she keep her promise to the frog makes all come
out happily; the frog stands revealed a prince in
disguise, and marries the princess. In “Dummling”
the despised stupid third and youngest brother
sets out to seek his elders; then come the three
acts of unkindness he prevents; then the failure of
the elders at the task set forth in the enchanted
castle, and Dummling’s success, due to the aid of
the creatures to whom he had shown kindness, followed
by his triumphant marriage to the youngest
and dearest of the princesses. In “The Cat and the
Mouse in Partnership,” the story opens with the
doubtful compact entered into by the mouse on the
cat’s representation of friendship, and her agreement
to his proposal that they lay by a pot of fat
for the winter. The cat has the hardihood to propose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the church as the safest hiding place for the pot
of fat, hypocritically saying that no one would
dare steal anything from a church. Then comes
the cat’s first “gulling” of the frank little mouse
with his story of having been asked to be godfather
to his cousin’s remarkable child. “Beauty and the
Beast” is another good character study, and from
an important point of view for the little child’s
story a better one, as this time virtue is unmistakably
triumphant.</p>

<p>The student will gradually develop sensibility to
the typical materials of folk story: human difficulty
overcome by supernatural aid; the task of
guessing a name, or the forfeit of a child, as a
condition for aid, as in “Rumpelstiltskin;” trial
and triumph of the despised ugly third sister or
stupid third brother; doughty deeds that overcome
bulk of body with nimbleness of wit, as in “Jack
the Giant Killer;” greed of wishing whose indulgence
precipitates loss of all, as in “The Fisherman
and his Wife;” reward of kindness to animals, as
in “The Hut in the Wood.”</p>

<p><i>The characters.</i> Characterize the people in the
story. In their varied company is the story-teller’s
opportunity to acquaint the child with the chief
kinds of persons to be found in literature and life;
the child himself, cherishing mother, doting grandmother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
virile father sending his sons out to find
their place in the world, loving brother and sister,
gentle people, hateful people, ill-tempered people,
cruel people, jealous people, kind people, wily people,
frank people, brave people, cowards, old people,
children, sad people, merry people. Besides these,
animals, pigs and bears, cows and hens and goats,
inhabit the child’s world side by side with man,
helping the story to make its way to the child’s
affections. Then there is the host of witching fairy
folk: fairies, giants, elves, pixies, witches, goblins.
Music as well as language has attempted to suggest
them, and with surprising agreement in artistic convention.
Language makes fairies light, airy, tripping;
goblins, grotesque; so does music. Language
makes the giant huge, clumsy, big-handed and big-footed,
but stupid; Wagner gives ponderous musical
motif to the dragon, the “laidly worm,” the giant of
his music dramas, and also makes him conquerable.</p>

<p><i>The workmanship, composition, and style.</i>
Much story-telling is spoiled by disregard of the
<i>composition</i> of the narrative. By composition here
is meant what is meant in painting or sculpture, the
arranging, or grouping, of the materials, to build
out the whole.</p>

<p>The method of grouping in the folk story is apparent.
At the beginning of the story are the time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
and place, some of the principal characters, and the
motive of the action. Next follows the action,
easily separable into rise, course, resolution. In
many of the stories, for example, in “The Frog
Prince,” there is after the action an explanation of
enchantment; and an assurance that all went well
ever after or quaint formula like that parodied in
“They stepped on a tin, and the tin bended, so my
story’s ended,” whose purpose, similar to that of
Shakespeare’s rhyming couplet in his earlier dramas,
is to give conclusive ending to the tale. Like “Mrs.
Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch,” who stayed on at the
theater after the curtain had gone down on the last
scene, the children, though sensitive to artistic reserve,
are not always satisfied with highly reserved
ending.</p>

<p>The story-teller should cultivate sensibility to
story-building; it is the creative principle of story-telling.
It is really surprising how lacking the beginner
is in consciousness of structure. He should
study structure until he can feel the tale making:
the scene putting in, the people coming in, the
motive revealing itself, the action starting, and
going forward until it arrives at climax and solution,
the whole winding up with happy prophecy of
the far future.</p>

<p>Grasp especially the composition of the <i>action</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
It is usually built on one of the following
plans:</p>

<p>(a) The single line of sequence, as in Hans Andersen’s
“Princess on the Pea,” or “The Sleeping
Beauty,” or “The Frog Prince;”</p>

<p>(b) The three-parallel line—what the first did,
what the second did, what the third did,—as in
“The Golden Pears” and in “Dummling;”</p>

<p>(c) The balanced antithetical plan, two contrasting
courses of action placed side by side,</p>

<table summary="The balanced antithetical plan">
  <tr>
    <td>what the beautiful, industrious child did</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>what the ugly, idle child did,</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">as in “Mother Holle” or in “Diamonds and
Toads.”</p>

<p>(d) The cumulative plan, as in “Henny-Penny,”
“The Cat and the Mouse in the Malt House,”
“The House that Jack Built,” “The Old Woman
and her Pig.” Do not miss the increase in interest
and suspense.</p>

<p>Note in the three-parallel structure the climactic
“thirdness” and its distinguishing characteristic;
it is the youngest and the stupid third member of
the family who turns out to be the cleverest and
most favored of fortune; it is Dummling who
marries the sweetest princess; it is the woodcutter’s
third daughter who proves considerate of the dumb<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
animals, frees the castle of enchantment, and marries
the prince.</p>

<p>Note, too, that the old-world story-tellers were
sensitive to the dramatic effect of the contrasts in
life. The miller’s daughter, innocent victim of her
father’s ambition, sits down in despair to weep over
an impossible task, and “at this moment the door
opens and in comes a comical little dwarf” who
with three magical whirrs of the spinning-wheel
turn a roomful of straw into gold. It is the very
day of her fifteenth birthday that the princess must
take to explore the castle and come upon unsuspected
spinning-wheel with which to prick her finger that
the witch’s prophecy may be fulfilled, but, as is the
merry good luck of romance, it is on the last day of
the hundred years that the prince goes hunting to
spy, not deer, but the towers of the identical castle in
which the Sleeping Beauty lies, inquires about it
of everyone until he meets the very man who can
tell him what “my father told me,” and rides
off to awaken the princess. It is always so in
literature sound at heart, whether it be in a Shakespearean
comedy, in which cottages appear in the
forest in the nick of time as night is falling and
lovely ladies and gallant knights are footsore and
weary; or whether it be in simple fairy tale abounding
in porridge pots, appearing when folks are on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
brink of starvation and cooking like mad, “as if
they would feed the whole world” at the magic
words, “Little pot, cook,” or in frogs popping out
of near by wells in time to say, “Your wish shall
be fulfilled, within a year you shall have a little
child,” or in small ovens and red apple-trees placed
“conveniently low.” The scholarly student of narrative
or dramatic technique recognizes this as
what he calls <i>comic relief</i> to offset the pathos of
the situation; the student lacking this knowledge
accepts with satisfaction the plausibleness of timely
happening.</p>

<p>After this careful work read the story again for
enriched appreciation of it. Now put the book
away and go about your business.</p>

<p>By and by see whether you know the story. Let
no mistrust born of book dependence and neglect of
the constructive imagination daunt you. Boldly
sketch in time and place, introduce the first characters,
suggest the motive of the action, start the action,
carry it forward to climax and solution, wind
up the whole. Now criticise your product. Is it
the thing you meant it to be? Thackeray tells us
his characters and plots got out of his hands and
finished themselves. Is it the tale as “’twas told
to you,” is it an improved version, is it a new story?
One and all may be in place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>Some will feel that they have spoiled the story.
They have bungled the structure through unskillful
placing, or omission of necessary details. They
have dulled life, dimmed beauty, obscured truth for
lack of words. Well, there is no harm done as yet.
These students, studying again the parts in which
they failed, will appreciate now more thoroughly
play and interplay of character, detail and course of
action, vivid word. The cat in “The Bremen
Town Musicians,” they will note, is capitally described
(in some accepted texts) as having a face
that looked like “three days of rainy weather;”
Snow-White and Rose-Red were “like the rose-bushes
in their mother’s garden;” they will not
miss in “The Cat and the Mouse” the cat’s sly description
of the pot of fat and the apt names he
gives his bogus godchildren. In this way the appropriate
word or phrase will come to them easily.</p>

<p>The question often asked, “Am I to hold myself
to the text?” is interesting. It applies of course
only to artistic texts, not to formless source material.
Some people contend that this destroys the
spirit of story-telling, making the art mechanical instead
of creative.</p>

<p>Story-telling is creative effort, never mere repetition
of the letter. It is creative effort, whether you
make live again something produced by another, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
make live more abundantly by perfecting matter
and form produced by another, or make new life.
The question cannot be answered offhand. If it
were true that the text form, the composition and
diction, in which you found the story, were the perfect
reflection of its life and that the story suffered
no change in your comprehension of it, and that it
were your intention to pass it on without modification
or loss to the child, and that he could receive it
without change in form, then the answer appears to
follow: you are to be faithful to the text. In some
cases the form in which the folk tale is found has
suffered through translation, in others it may be
intrinsically faulty; in many texts of “The Frog
Prince,” for example, the Iron John incident is too
detached and very much out of perspective. The
story-teller who can make it better should do so,
or who feels prompted to give the children another
product from old materials will use them, though
the folklorists will forbid him to palm off his product
as old-world lore. Any training in story-telling
that does not give outlet and direction to such
ability and to originality neglects an important
obligation to the student. It is notable, by the way,
that it is the student with the literary artist’s instinct
who is surest to “get” the style of any good
original he may be reproducing. Proper simplification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
of standard texts and the question of adaptation
to younger and older audiences will be considered
later.</p>

<p>Are we not inconsistent in our attitude toward
form in language? We profess to recognize reverently
an intimate relation between the matter and
the manner in the sculptor’s, the painter’s, the musician’s
art. But we constantly deny any integrity to
language as a medium of expression. We do not,
to be sure, attempt to tamper with the form the
great poets gave their message. Indeed we “get”
the verse running through the simple prose tale, although
it is scarcely less artless than is the prose.
But everyone because he can speak in words appears
to feel competent to tell the prose body of the stories
in “his own words.” Now, every word in the
folktale may not be so necessary to its thought as
very minute details in Shakespeare’s or even in
Kipling’s or Andersen’s or Stockton’s form are considered
to his thought. But there is such a thing as
folk-story style, easy, loose sentence liberally sprinkled
with <i>and</i>s and <i>so</i>s, picture-making word, distinctive
epithet, recurrent jingle, rhythmic swing.
It is surprising how insensible students are to it.
Yet it is due largely, no doubt, to the best of all
causes, the belief that the story is to be given living
form by the teller. Dull rote memorizing will not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of course do this. The method of study set forth
suggests how the story-teller may easily develop
sensibility to folk-story style and easily train himself
to “do,” or “catch,” it.</p>

<p>Let us not be afraid of a due regard for form.
Right attention to form is not testimony to the
worth of the superficial. The poet says, “The
soul is form and doth the body make.” Let us see
to it that we make the language body of our story
by clear reflection of its spirit.</p>

<p>The question of oral interpretation, or oral
form, the more important aspect of form, while
properly a matter to be settled by the student during
the stage of preparation, is here more conveniently
considered under the next head.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Telling the Story</span></h3>

<p>This is truly the stage of creation. No matter
how familiar you made yourself with the story in
the privacy of your studio, you will now find happening
something surprising. The story will come
to your own ears and stand revealed to your imagination
with the joy of discovery. The truth is,
it was made to be shared with another, and you
hadn’t it at all until you gave it away. What spontaneity
rewards you! How you find yourself rising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
to the occasion—your own latent capabilities, the
expanding possibilities in the story, the response of
your audience!</p>

<p>Let us take up the topic, <i>telling the story</i>, under
the practical heads:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) <i>Choosing or meeting story-telling time</i>;</p>

<p>(2) <i>The story-teller’s part</i>;</p>

<p>(3) <i>Controlling canons of the story-teller’s
part</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>(1) <i>Choosing or meeting story-telling time.</i>
“To everything,” says Ecclesiastes, “there is a season
and a time for every purpose under the heaven
... a time to weep and a time to laugh ... a time
to keep silence and a time to speak.”</p>

<p>Is there an ideal time for telling a story? Assuredly;
at this time the story comes to the listener
with more pleasure, or stronger appeal to the feelings.
But the “pedagogical” story-teller, parent
or teacher, must take care not to mistake suitable
occasion. The error is not that the story-teller may
have, like the Ancient Mariner, a tale of sin and
virtue to tell to the soul that must hear it. To say
that the story must not be narrowed to didactic
purpose is not to exclude altogether the story that
may work spiritual reformation. The trouble is
that the story-teller sometimes precipitates irritation
rather than reformation by untimeliness. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
moment when the child is defiant or angry and the
teacher or parent cross is not the psychological
moment for such a story. It is at the turn in the
tide of feeling that the story-teller may send into
the wavering stream the saving grace of the tale.</p>

<p>There are times when the pupils are “on” for a
mental frolic; these are the times for the play or
“funny” stories. Sometimes, in order to quicken
desirable response, the teacher or parent will judge
it better to run counter to the mood of the children.
She will sharpen the wits of dull children with a
humorous story, or broaden the horizon of the
narrowly matter-of-fact with a tale of adventure
or of supernatural occurrence. Celebrations or
memorials call out appropriate stories. The early
Hebrew father took advantage of his sons’ questions
about the festivals celebrated in their midst to
tell the great Bible story. The Christian Church
sometimes narrates the lives of the saints to her
children on feast days to inspire the heroism of holy
living. Things observed in nature, and home and
school circumstances, will suggest many stories.
And when all has been said about special times, it
remains true that almost any time in the wonder
years of childhood is story time.</p>

<p>But the teacher may say, “Story-telling time
means precisely eleven-fifteen on Tuesday morning;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
the individual teacher has nothing to say about it.”
The thing to do, then, is to induce the story-telling
mood at eleven-fifteen Tuesday morning. What
we should urge here between ourselves is the obligation
to give place heartily at this time to the story.
No matter how ill things may have gone and how
cross we ourselves may have become, we must now
let pleasurable anticipation take possession of the
classroom.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The story-teller’s part.</i> The rôle of story-teller
is simple yet subtle, more easily shown than
explained. The story-teller is recounter of a happening,
real or fictitious, merry or pathetic, that
because of its appeal to the imagination and sympathies
has been given currency in language. To
share with another the glimpse of life it gives the
imagination, the feeling it arouses, the æsthetic
satisfaction it yields, was man’s reason for telling
it. The story-teller’s part, then, is so to employ and
interpret the medium of currency as to free this
force.</p>

<p><i>Beginning the story.</i> The story-teller should
begin the story with the air of having something interesting
and enjoyable to tell. If the contents of
the story had not been interesting, they would never
have made a story; the story-teller may depend on
this intrinsic interest. He should have also the air<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
of leisure; story-telling is one of the social arts of
leisure and pleasure; besides, stories record significant
occurrences, which should be given the emphasis
of time. His initial manner should give hint of
the spirit of the particular story he is to tell. The
first phrase, “There were five-and-twenty tin soldiers,”
sounds the playful martial spirit of Hans
Andersen’s “Brave Tin Soldier;” the story-teller
echoes it in martial bearing and in martial swing
and ring in his speech, in, of course, the playful
manner of a story about a little toy soldier. Mother-love
broods through the story of “The Wolf and
the Seven Kids;” the story-teller suggests, in voice
and eyes and fostering posture, its loving pride and
anxiety. Should the story-teller begin in rather
obvious make-believe-matter-of-fact style, his eyes
hinting fun, the children will chuckle in delighted
anticipation of a nonsense or a humorous story.
The wholly impassive manner adopted by some
story-tellers in telling “funny” stories to adult
audiences will not do with children. The adult’s
enjoyment consists largely in his ability to remake
as fun what the teller is representing as sober
fact. Children, because of their lack of knowledge
and experience, need more leading. Stories like
“The Three Bears” correspond in spirit to nursery
rhymes like “This little pig went to market;” they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
should be kept as childlike, mimetic, rhythmic, and
playful. Southey gives the key to the spirit of
“The Three Bears” in the setting. Every detail
shows how well he caught the child-note: interest in
wild animals, the bear a favorite; tendency to dramatic
mimicry; response to rhythm; pleasure in
possessions, this very complete “house of their
own,” kept by bears, delights the children. A hero
story like “Jack the Giant Killer” calls for a bold
spirit. “Snow-White and Rose-Red” sounds the
domestic note: cheerful fireside group; mother
reading from a “large book,” children spinning,
animals lying near. The setting here, though long,
may easily be made attractive by the story-teller’s
own pleasure in every detail.</p>

<p>The characters also should be introduced with
hint of their personality. “Snow-White and Rose-Red
were as happy, as busy and cheerful,” says the
story-teller, showing cheerful pleasure in them, “as
any two children in the world.” “Snow-White,”
softening voice and eyes, “was more quiet and
gentle; Rose-Red,” adopting a livelier manner,
“liked better to run about the fields and pick flowers
and chase butterflies.” “There was once a widow
who had two daughters; one of them,” says the
story-teller, smiling in the pleasure goodness and
beauty, whether physical or spiritual, always excite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
in us, “was pretty and industrious; the other,”
voice and face expressing disapproval of her, “was
ugly and idle.” “A certain man had a donkey,”
says the story-teller, with such suggestion of possibilities
in the donkey evident in forward posture, in
face and voice, that the listener at once suspects
that, as Hans Andersen would put it, that donkey
“became worth talking about.”</p>

<p>The story-teller begins then, as both prophet and
sibyl, telling yet, especially at this stage, not “giving
it away.” He must let the story reveal and the
child discover; this is the joy of it.</p>

<p><i>Building out the story.</i> Having laid the foundation
upon which he is to build the happening, the
story-teller should, as a rule, in building fashion
pause. He then enters upon the action, carrying it
forward, slowly or rapidly, according as its course
demands, arousing suspense and increasing the interest
in the outcome. How he does this will be
suggested farther on. As the story proceeds he
must of course treat character consistently. Sensibility
to the nature of the particular character he is
interpreting will enable him to voice and conduct it
appropriately. Nothing more than suggestion is in
place. The story-teller’s fairy voice may be light
and tinkling like silver bells, his witch made graphic
through pointed, hag-like chin and fingers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
stooped body, his fox smooth and sly, his wolf
snarling, his giant, as said before, big-voiced and
ponderous. He can hardly fail to catch the steely
high voice and proud manner Hans Andersen intended
for the vain but delightful Darning Needle.</p>

<p>After, as a rule, pausing to give effect to the
climax of the action, the story-teller passes in many
stories to a brief but clear explanation of enchantment,
and winds up the whole happily, leaving the
child supremely pleased.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Controlling canons of the story-teller’s part.</i>
Some of the chief canons governing the story-teller
are <i>directness</i>, <i>spontaneity</i>, <i>graphicness</i>, <i>reserve</i>,
<i>skill in the use of the voice</i>, <i>simplicity</i>.</p>

<p><i>Directness</i> is the principle of immediateness, by
virtue of which <i>story</i> and <i>listener</i> are brought into
contact. It has its roots in the social and magnetic
nature of the art. In its fullest sense it is comprehensive
of all the other canons.</p>

<p>Directness concerns both the outer and the inner
self of the story-teller.</p>

<p>The part played by the outer self is simple. Before
beginning his story the story-teller should
“go to” and “gather” his listeners. He does this
by assuming the physical position and mental attitude
of communicator. A person who has anything
to tell another that he thinks will move or please<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
him does not stand aloof. The story-teller should
not stand aloof. He may place himself in front of
his listeners, at such a point as will enable him to
command all. Before beginning he will get the listening
attention by invitation of posture and direct
face to face look, or by the magnetic force of the
story now animating his whole person. Some
story-tellers then begin to address themselves to
someone near by whom they feel to be the most
responsive listener, or whom they wish to interest,
then address a wider and wider circle until they are
reaching everyone. Others project the story into
the ears of someone in the middle of the group,
making this the radiating point from which to
grasp all.</p>

<p>The story-teller through his outer self must observe
the principle of directness in another way.
In looks and actions his external self must help to
convey the spirit of the story: posture, facial expression,
gesture, voice must not contradict but declare
what the lips are saying. It is in recognition
of the relation between the external self of the
story-teller and his story that some story-tellers
“make up,” or put on appropriate costume. This
has its power and charm. But for the “everydayness”
of story-telling in home and school it is undesirable,
unnecessary, and impracticable. What is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
necessary is something less troublesome but more
important: such domination, or absorption, of the
external self by the spirit of the story as will subdue
it to the story-teller’s use. This will help to induce
the right feeling response. Feeling, as everyone
knows, is “catching.” Fun will call out fun;
pathos, pathos; gladness at beauty, goodness, or
truth, like joy. The whole being of the Ancient
Mariner told his story. Simple stories do not demand
emotional intensity, but the principle remains.
The student will find it helpful to sit opposite
Tadema’s “Reading Homer,” to get an idea of the
recounter’s abandon.</p>

<p>The principle of directness as it applies through
the inner self of the story-teller is as easy to understand.
The story-teller must not allow any intruding
mental state or circumstance, any intruding
“self,” to come between the story and the listener.
Such a self may be</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) The diffident or embarrassed self of the
self-conscious story-teller.</p>

<p>(2) The vain or affected self of the insincere
story-teller.</p>

<p>(3) The weakening self of the patronizing
story-teller.</p>

<p>(4) The non-seeing self of the non-spontaneous
story-teller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>(5) The non-sensible, or non-artistic, self
of the “sledge hammer” story-teller.</p>

<p>(6) The non-communicating self of the
“acting” story-teller.</p>

<p>(7) The misinformed self of the lifeless
story-teller.</p>

</div>

<p>(1) The self-conscious self is not hard to overcome.
Diffidence arises from a false modesty, due
to the story-teller’s failure to realize his obligation
to the child and to the story. His part now is not
to occupy himself with mistrust of his own ability,
but to bend all his energies to interpreting the story
for the listener. Embarrassment may be due to
natural shyness or to lack of ease in the art of story-telling.
If due to the first, it should also disappear
as the story-teller realizes his obligation; if to the
second, time and practice will probably cure it. It
is well to throw off embarrassment vigorously at
the outset and plunge into the story; it is surprising
how easy and complete will be the victory.</p>

<p>(2) Vain insincerity is a more serious intrusion.
It shows itself usually in an affected manner and a
false ring in the voice. The story-teller is not engaged
in telling the story, but in exhibiting himself.
The children will at once sense such a fraud. The
pity is that they should ever have had the chance
to do so; it is often the beginning of insincerity in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
them. This story-teller also must strive to realize
his important office.</p>

<p>(3) A patronizing story-teller is as great an
obstruction. His manner is unctuous and “glawming.”
It dwarfs the listener, belittling him and
undermining his frankness. Hear how the great
queen did in Morris’s tale:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then she held him a little season on her weary and happy breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And she told him of Sigmund and Volsung and the best sprung from the best;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>She spake to the new-born baby as one who might understand</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The spirit of the italicized words should be the
story-teller’s guide. Watch the child the first time
he comes under the sway of the patronizing story-teller,
how he eyes the babying smile meant to be
engaging, how he holds aloof. The story-teller must
trust the child and trust the story. He chooses the
story for its suitability in arousing and directing
the child’s imagination, sympathies, or æsthetic
sense. Having made the selection on this basis, his
part now is to be, not officious meddler, no matter
how well meaning, but communicator.</p>

<p>The patronizing story-teller is inclined to “thin
out” the story. There is a proper kind of remaking
allowable in telling a story or in fitting it
to younger or older audiences. If too much is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
necessary, the story is probably not in any degree
suitable; it might better be left until the children
are older. There are for the meantime plenty of
stories more nearly available. Some modes of simplification
of the content allowable are: omission of
details in description and omission of minor characters
and incidents, in some cases to be added
later; preparatory talk or explanation, reduced to
its very lowest terms; conversation or explanation
after the telling, to be followed soon by another
telling. The form may be made easier by simplification
of the complicated sentences or unchildlike
modes of speech, by very sparing use of running
explanation, by use of roundabout easier phrase to
be replaced by the directly descriptive word.</p>

<p>The power and the glory for the listening child
are more surely in the message as the <i>seer</i>, yourself
or another story inventor, saw and delivered it,
than in any garbled paraphrase of it, all that many
attempting story-telling can manage. Their opportunity
lies in the field of interpretation, unless they
are genuinely engaged in changing the story or in
themselves telling a different story or in truly artistic
simplification. Have faith in the little child: in
his sensibility to artistic fitness, in his intelligence,
in his ready sympathy. Have faith in the story.</p>

<p>Best of all modes, the story may be simplified,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
not by making it over into something else, but by
making it into itself through interpretation.</p>

<p>(4) Some story-tellers bring an uninformed
self to the story. The root of their difficulty is
failure to see and feel the child world. So important
is the principle of insight that it will be
taken up at length, under the heading <i>spontaneity</i>.</p>

<p>(5) A story-teller lacking in artistic sensibility
does not discern the story as a form of art, though
a naïve form. He intrudes between the story and
the child what, for lack of a better term, the writer
called a “sledge-hammer” self, or a didactic self.
It resorts to pedagogical pounding, dealing largely
in stress on words and in the falling inflection. It
vainly attempts to force the story and the child into
contact through the intellect, or sometimes the bugaboo
of conscience, instead of by the open pathway
made by freeing the spirit of the story.</p>

<p>One example, by the way, of the tendency to
force the didactic note is the made over version of
Southey’s “Three Bears,” in which the story begins
with Silver Locks (the little wee woman of
the older version is coming back) and makes much
of her naughtiness, left in Southey’s story to indirect
playful condemnation. This puts her at once
in the emphatic position, robbing the three bears of
their rank, and the story and the children of the
play spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>(6) The story-teller who confounds dramatization
(not dramatic suggestion) with narration
substitutes a detached exhibiting self for the story-teller’s
intimate, communicating self. He fails to
tell the story. This also will be considered at length
under another canon.</p>

<p>(7) Finally, an intruding self is the misinformed
self of the lifeless story-teller. It makes story-telling
nothing but colorless word-calling. It arises
from a false psychology, resting on the assumption
that the child’s imaginative and emotional life differs
in kind from the adult’s (sound in so far as
it condemns strain on the imagination and the emotions);
a false ethics, mistrusting attention to oral
form, or to beauty of speech; wrong habit in
speech. Whatever its source, it prevents the contact
of child and story.</p>

<p>The canon of directness, then, requires that both
the outer and the inner self lend themselves to telling
the story to the listener without obstruction.</p>

<p><i>Spontaneity</i> is the canon of naturalness, by virtue
of which the story has genuine life. It creates the
illusion that the story-teller is spinning his tale
from within out, its life having become part and
parcel of his imaginative and emotional experience.
It depends upon insight. The story-teller of childlike
tales must “live with our children,” as Froebel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
said; he must cultivate sensibility to the child’s
world, catch its spirit of play and happiness and
activity, respect its serious moods, note its affectionate
intimacy with animals, cats and dogs and hens
and horses, respond to its humor, feel above all its
emotional sincerity and simplicity. The child carries
himself unaffectedly. It is easy to detect the
story-teller who fails of insight into the child’s
world. He is either wholly insensible to its characteristics,
or he grotesquely exaggerates everything.
The first method leaves the child unmoved, the
second undermines his sincerity.</p>

<p>The story-teller need not, however, be afraid to
give full value to story materials: to idealize its
people and happenings; to make its heroines
frankly good and beautiful, its supernatural properties
adequate, its “great huge bears” satisfyingly
huge; to give its seven-leagued giants voice possibilities
that will cause half-quaking, half-chuckling
listeners to shake in their shoes in whole-hearted
enjoyment; to make its porridge pots, that cooked
or stopped the minute a certain good little girl said
so, magical. Story art, like all art, idealizes its
materials the moment it selects them; the story-teller
in turn holds them up to view of the imagination.
Nor need the adult story-teller be afraid
of illumining the view more fully than might a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
child teller, by the light of the adult’s richer knowledge
and experience. No, the story-teller is not to
impoverish nor dull the story; but he is to guard
against giving the listener the impression of unsuccessful
pretense at it, and against urging him to
strained imagining and feeling. Until, alas, custom
stales him to its false ring, a child condemns the
unseeing story-teller, not recognizing him as kith
nor kin.</p>

<p>To satisfy the canon of spontaneity, then, the
story-teller must see and feel the tale he attempts to
tell, that he may re-create its spirit.</p>

<p>By <i>graphicness</i> is meant vividness, by virtue of
which the story is made plain to the imagination
and quick to the feelings. It is secured by the
various means of oral interpretation (to be considered
under another heading), helped out by facial
expression, and sometimes by gesture or by dramatic
suggestion. It is governed by the imperative
complementary canon of <i>reserve</i>. <i>Reserve</i> is the
canon of artistic restraint; as applied here, it keeps
story-telling the art of communicating, not allowing
it to pass beyond the limits of dramatic suggestion
into dramatization.</p>

<p>It is the greater degree of artistic reserve that
divides story-telling sharply from dramatization
and gives it its special magnetic charm and enduring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
strength. The essence of dramatization is sensible
actualization, the essence of story-telling is
imaginative suggestion. The story tells, yet leaves
to the listener exhaustless discovery. At each re-telling
the story allures the listener’s imagination
to catch added import. The listener maturing into
the adult may penetrate a specific detail in the childlike
allegory and uncover a symbol of everlasting
life, eternal youth or truth or beauty, and having
found it, he can never with listening exhaust the
depths of it. Is it fanciful to conjecture whether
it be some response to this imperishable integrity
that urges children to demand the same tale over
and over again? Psychology has discerned in
them wiseacres learning the realities of life through
play. Why not also through story?</p>

<p>Dramatic suggestion as an aid to language and
subordinate to it is, however, in place. It was indulged
in freely by primitive story-tellers. Children
use it instinctively. Hint of happening, by
show of action; or glimpse of character, by posture,
facial expression, suggestion in tone, is sufficient.
Such hint at once makes the situation or character
plain to the imagination. The queen in Hans Andersen’s
“Princess on the Pea,” for example, is well
brought into the story by the story-teller’s taking on
a look of shrewdness, with perhaps shaking of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
head, before he tells what the queen thinks of this
“real” princess who presents herself thus bedraggled.
In doing this the story-teller must preserve
the appearance and intention of narration. As
soon as some students of story-telling attempt dramatic
suggestion they lose the listener and lapse into
playing rather than telling. Even when dialogue
or monologue demands a degree of impersonation
the story-teller must keep in mind that it is for the
purpose of <i>telling</i> the story to the listener. He
<i>shows</i>, or <i>illustrates</i>, looking back to insure that the
listener is following, or to make communication.
After the story-teller’s pantomime of surprise and
delight at finding the shoes, in “The Elves and the
Shoemaker,” for example, he looks at his listeners
to communicate his feeling to them and invite their
corresponding emotion, then makes verbal communication
to them.</p>

<p>Suggestive gesture may also be used to make language
graphic. (Beginners often neglect to keep
the hands free for gesture they may be impelled
to use.) For the sake of the child we must recover,
if we have lost it, the speaking face, animated body,
and eloquent hand of our childhood. As the word
gains in meaning, we resort to gesture more
sparingly. Gesture should precede the word.
Watch the unconscious child in his use of gesture;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
he tells with the hand and body before he tells
with the word. Some beginners drop a gesture so
quickly that they might as well have done without
it, others sustain it too long. Gesture is used, as a
rule, for one of two chief purposes, demonstration
or appeal to the imagination or feelings.
When the story-teller is using it to show shape or
size or place, he does not need it any longer after
he has done this. If he is using it to send the imagination
of his listeners out or to appeal to their
emotions, he must sustain it until it has accomplished
its effect. Sometimes a quick strong gesture
makes powerful appeal to the imagination;
sometimes sustained gesture serves as aftermath,
still telling to the imagination. Gesture must not
appear detached from the story-teller, that is, put
on from the outside; it should come from within,
in the story-teller’s effort to tell. It is helpful, too,
to note that gesture partakes of the imitativeness of
art,—thus we speak of <i>kingly</i> gesture, <i>commanding</i>
gesture, <i>witchlike</i> gesture. When dealing with
things that address themselves to the expanding imagination,
gesture should be indefinite and broadly
suggestive rather than definitive. Too prescriptive
an indication of the size of the bears in “The
Three Bears,” for example, dwarfs for some generous
imaginations the delightful hugeness of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
great huge bear and the irresistible littleness of the
little small wee bear. Free sweeping gesture is in
place in the heroic legend.</p>

<p>Suggestive posture is another means of giving
vividness. The story-teller might learn much from
the painter and the sculptor about the eloquence of
pose. The Pre-Raphaelite school of painting was
no doubt guilty of extravagance, but in pose and
facial expression it caught some of the secrets of
artistic suggestion. We know how the sculptor, too,
represents listening, or surprise, or courage. The
sculptor is, of course, very much more dependent on
posture than is the speaker. But posture should
help the story-teller, just as do tone and quality and
rate of voice. It will not do, for example, to settle
back heavily in the seat while telling, “Out popped
the gingerbread boy and—” It must not be forgotten,
however, that pose also is under the imperative
restriction of reserve; narration is not the
static art of posing. Constant or violent change in
posture, too, except in particular stories demanding
it, is out of place; story-telling is the quiet if animated
and graphic art of communication. Posture
and facial expression, like gesture, should precede
the word, prophesying of it, and sometimes be sustained
during pause for effect.</p>

<p>Before leaving this canon, the story-teller should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
understand that graphicness should sometimes be
veiled under a pervading elusiveness. Some stories
should be wrapped about with the charm of impalpability;
the mystery of them is the secret of their
appeal. This is the atmosphere for the romantic
fairy tale, like “The Sleeping Beauty,” and for
many of the legends and romances.</p>

<p>We are now ready to sum up the canon of
graphicness. We have defined it as the dynamic
principle of vividness by virtue of which the story
is made plain to the imagination. It is secured by
the supreme agency of speech, aided sometimes, in
greater or less degree, by posture, gesture, facial expression,
and dramatic suggestion. It is under the
imperative restriction of the canon of reserve.</p>

<p>In an art defined as story-telling <i>the skillful use
of the voice</i> is the chief technique to be mastered,
and, alas, the least regarded. It is, however, gaining
ground. Story-tellers are finding it increasingly
reasonable to believe there is close connection
between what is to be told and how it is told.
While it is true that so strong is the vitality of the
<i>what</i> that it will usually triumph in some degree
over the <i>how</i>, this is no sound argument for abandoning
it to that fate. It is also true, because of the
social nature of language, that the listener will do
much, no matter how dull the how, to inform and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
transform the what in the light of his own knowledge
and experience. This is precisely in just measure
what he is to do. But this argument also is
weak.</p>

<p>Man tries to utter his meaning, to give sound to
the sense of his thought. All students of words
appear to agree to this as a primary creative principle.
And in the utterance of language he employs
instinctively what some story-tellers condemn as
the “show” tricks of elocutionists: suggestive
quality or pitch of voice; slow or rapid rate of
speaking; grouping, inflection, and pause. Mastery
of this instinctive use of speech in its fullness
and perfection, as a means to an end, is what is
meant by mastery of oral technique. Whatever the
method of mastery, direct or indirect, surely the end
should be granted.</p>

<p>It has taken many people a long time to convince
themselves that the speaking voice is in need of
proper exercise and training. They have expected
too much of the speaker. The living person back
of the speech, the personality, is the chief element in
speech; without the speaker to utter his meaning,
speech would be nothing but empty word mouthing.
But they should give the speaker at least as much
fair play as has the singer, training in the use of
the voice. The set jaw, wrong coördination, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
half-open throat, the closed glottis, or “voice box,”
the immobile lip (whose remedy, by the way, is not
mouthing), the thick tongue,—all these, causing
indistinctness, nasality, throatiness, are impediments
to speech. So are throat or nasal or dental obstructions.
So is incorrect breathing.</p>

<p>The nice art of enunciation and articulation is
worth mastery. Phonics appears to some people
like a science of very small things. It has not only
an æsthetic value, but, if you must separate them, an
intellectual value. Masters of enunciation and articulation
give not only finish but richer meaning to
language. This, again, is no doubt due to the lively
connection between sound and sense. Open mouth
and throat well to pronounce the vowels in <i>joy</i>, or
<i>shine</i>, and confirm the truth of this; note the force
of vowels, consonants, or aspirate pronounced accurately
in <i>glisten</i>, <i>shimmering</i>, <i>hushed</i>, <i>croaked</i>,
<i>scream</i>, <i>harsh</i>. It will be understood of course
that the requirements of character suggestion may
demand slurring, chopping off, drawling, and all
sorts of speech vices; when in place they become
virtues.</p>

<p>We are fond of using the expression “as natural
as breathing.” How many are breathing as nature
would have them? The speaker should be past
master of breathing: be able to expand the diaphragm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
and fill full and deep, to supplement this
basal stock, as opening the mouth to enunciate a
vowel or to speak a phrase gives easy, unobtrusive
opportunity, to expend breath economically.</p>

<p>The story-teller should “find” his particular
voice. To do this he may read or speak in his ordinary
tone and note where it vibrates. This is his
natural, or at least second-nature, voice, working
basis for improvement; re-placing, purifying,
strengthening, making flexible.</p>

<p>He should be able to place tone, to give it this
or that quality, as the needs of interpretation may
demand. He should be able to keep feeling out of
the voice, and to speak with feeling without violating
the principle of reserve.</p>

<p>Understanding, feeling, and æsthetic appreciation
are rooted in the story-teller, to be sure, but
they must be transmitted by the organs of voice.
He will be delighted to find that the physical action
of these organs, if easy and responsive, appears to
deepen his own understanding and feeling and to
send them in greater fullness to the listener.</p>

<p>One of the most important principles of oral
technique is perspective, through which the central
idea is kept dominant throughout the story.
Proper application of this principle gives the whole
story unity and increasing interest and point. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
give the story perspective the story-teller employs
grouping, pause, rate, pitch, and inflection. Space
permits of nothing more than this mere enumeration
of these means and of pointing out a very
limited use of one or two. Beginners often err in
grouping. In the story of “The Frog Prince,” for
example, they will say “there was a king,” making
this a more or less complete and leading idea, instead
of “there was a king who had beautiful
daughters;” at this point, moreover, by use of the
complete falling inflection they destroy the subordinate
relation of this idea to the succeeding one,
“but the youngest was the most beautiful.” Untrained
speakers and badly trained readers overuse
the falling inflection. Story-tellers will find it helpful
to practice the sustained, or “forward pointing,”
voice. It is necessary to the proper building
out of units of thought. The story-teller should
“make,” for example, the word picture with the
voice, bit by bit, much as the painter does the line
and color picture with the brush, each added detail
going toward the whole.</p>

<p>Mastery of pause is important. In ordinary
communication the story-teller, as does everyone
else, uses pause a hundred times a day, but he is
inclined at first to overlook its part in story-telling.
He should learn to pause to make clear not only the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
divisions of single sentences, but of the whole story,
its setting, action, resolution, and close. He should
use it also to set off for dramatic emphasis or emotional
effect significant or climactic circumstances,
persons, or details of action. Pause is one of the
simplest and most effective means of emphasis. Of
course, like every other means of speech, it is sometimes
best ignored.</p>

<p>This bare glance at speech technique shows us
that the story-teller should have such command
over the agencies of oral transmission as will enable
him to convey the story fully to the listener. Let
his point of departure be the effort to utter his
meaning.</p>

<p>When telling stories to young children the story-teller
may do more or less <i>“leading” of the feelings
and the taste</i>, thus educating the child to respond
to what is playful or brave or humorous or
beautiful. If the story-teller will show pleasure in
obedience, fun, good-nature, loveliness in nature or
art, shape, for example, or color, or sound, or adaptability
to use, the imitative listener will respond
in like appreciation. Some beginners find it difficult
to do this. Sometimes the source of the
difficulty is bad habit in reading. This affects
story-telling when the story has been prepared from
the printed page. The student comes to the story-telling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
class with the habit formed of suppressing in
his reading appreciation of excellence or of beauty.
Two students talking together outside of class may
do the natural thing; if describing beauty—loveliness
of nature, human loveliness, goodness, heroism—they
show pleasure in it by smiling lip and
softly shining eye; “beauty,” as Wordsworth has
it, “makes them glad.” But nine times out of ten
the beginner in story-telling who has prepared the
story from a book allows no appreciation of beauty
to get into voice or self as he tells, for example,
“In olden times, when wishing was having, there
lived a king who had beautiful daughters, but the
youngest was so lovely that even the sun himself,
who has seen so much, marveled whenever he
shone in her face.” He is not of course to magnify
this phrase unduly; he must keep it in proper
perspective.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how imperfectly we talk and
tell. As indicated before, words as they are uttered
represent to the young listener, and, so lively
is language, in great degree to the adult also, exactly
what the speaker puts into them. If he utters
<i>bright</i> dully, he contradicts truth; if he pronounces
<i>loved</i> coldly, he robs it of the human warmth of itself;
if he mumbles <i>lovely</i>, he dwarfs beauty. To
correct wrong habit in speaking, the student of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
story-telling should cultivate sensibility to the feeling
and æsthetic suggestions in language, and during
the stage of apprenticeship be content to be
conscious until more spontaneous appreciation shall
relieve him of watchfulness.</p>

<p>To take another example, in the story of “The
Hut in the Wood,” beginners often fairly shout
“night was coming on,” “the owl hooted,” “the
trees rustled.” The thing to be communicated here
through the details is the emotional state of the girl.
It is communicated by sympathetic interpretation:
lowering of voice, with suggestion in it of the
sounds heard, accompanied by shrinking in posture
and dawning of fear in the face.</p>

<p>Leading is open to abuse. The more the language
of the story tells on its face when interpreted
so as to set free the associations bound up in it, the
more the story-teller must trust it to carry its own
effects.</p>

<p>The story-teller is governed most by the supreme
canon of <i>simplicity</i>. His must be a peculiarly
unelaborate, apparently artless art. In gesture and
facial expression, in dramatic suggestion, in speech,
his is that form or degree of the artistic manner
that will carry to the listener the unaffected, frank,
childlike kind of life with which the child story
deals: <i>not intense in manner</i>; <i>not intellectual nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
artificial in gesture</i>; <i>not pedantic nor studied in
speech</i>—but <i>sincere and simple</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Child’s Part in Story-Telling</span></h3>

<p>Let us tabulate some of the things the child naturally
does as his part in story-telling. The table will
be incomplete, but it may be suggestive. What is
the child’s part in story-telling?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) <i>It is listening.</i></p>

<p>(2) <i>It is remaining silent.</i></p>

<p>(3) <i>It is commenting.</i></p>

<p>(4) <i>It is joining in.</i></p>

<p>(5) <i>It is re-telling.</i></p>

<p>(6) <i>It is partial re-telling.</i></p>

<p>(7) <i>It is telling other stories.</i></p>

<p>(8) <i>It is inventing stories.</i></p>

<p>(9) <i>It is expressing sometimes story images
in other media.</i></p>

<p>(10) <i>It is sometimes playing the stories.</i></p>

<p>(11) <i>It is growing by the power and grace
of the story.</i></p>

</div>

<p>(1) <i>It is listening.</i> Let us not underrate the
child’s quiet part as listener harkening to the story
again and again to catch wider and deeper vision
of it.</p>

<p>(2) <i>It is remaining silent.</i> When it is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
silence of delight, be content; this is result enough.
When it is the spiritual silence out of whose brooding
may be born reverent awe or insight into justice
or cheerful good will or virile endeavor, bring
all your wisdom to bear to decide whether you will
help or hinder by leaving the child to himself, and
in case of doubt give the story the benefit of it,
trusting it to deliver its own message in due season.</p>

<p>(3) <i>It is commenting.</i> On the other hand, do
not be unmindful of another opportunity. A child,
like an adult, is inclined to talk some stories over;
meet him halfway. Indeed, in some cases, lead the
way; stimulate an inert class to talk over some of
the more objective type of stories. It is your opportunity
to get and clarify the child’s point of
view.</p>

<p>(4) <i>It is joining in.</i> We learn, from the snatches
of story-telling history that have come down to us,
that it was the custom of the audience to join in at
the rhythmic repetitions, as people do at the chorus
of a comic song. The children show the same tendency;
encourage it. It not only pleases them, but
it is an easy and natural beginning in reproduction.
The child’s dramatic sense prompts him to come in
also when the story-teller reaches dialogue; encourage
this also.</p>

<p>(5) <i>It is re-telling.</i> Rightly conducted, reproduction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
of stories is profitable for shaping the
pupil’s thought and language mode. But is the
exercise rightly conducted? The children listen
in breathless delight as the teacher tells the story;
she demands it “back,” the children struggle, interest
flags, teacher and children toil on, and joy
dies out in story and listener. This is too bad.
Story-telling is a legitimate opportunity for unalloyed
pleasure; the school is not too lavish of such
times. What is the root of the trouble? It lies in
one or more sources: the practice of requiring premature
reproduction of some types of story not
grasped by the children to the definite point of re-telling;
the teacher’s unreasonable or wrong standards
of achievement; the pupil’s lack of familiarity
with the story, due to the teacher’s tendency
to turn reproduction into a test or task.</p>

<p>The tendency of the school to require immediate
verbal reproduction of all stories is unwise utilitarianism.
It is limiting the teacher’s choice of
stories undesirably. Feeling compelled to demand
reproduction of every story, the teacher confines
her choice to stories the children will take hold of
easily. We can all testify that we have heard and
been moved or delighted by recitals we could not
reproduce; their purpose was to accomplish exactly
what they did accomplish. The child is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
capable of responding in æsthetic pleasure or spiritual
uplift to stories as yet beyond his re-telling.
It is highly desirable that he be given the chance
of contact with such material and that its seed be
given time to root and flower. To urge him to
immediate reproduction is to develop shallow glibness
at the sacrifice of something finer. Under the
compulsion of reproduction the teacher excludes,
also, not only beautiful and spiritualizing stories, but
long stories. Long stories are not desirable on the
mere ground of length, but even this ground has its
claim. The longer stories give sustained exercise
to the imagination, and they give the story-teller
ampler field to set forth character or action and to
let the story yield fuller measure of delight. Short
and long and longer and shorter are all in place.
And not all need nor should be reproduced.</p>

<p>How much should the teacher expect when she
asks pupils to tell back any stories they have heard
only once, or at most twice? Exactly what the
pupil gives, what he grasped. Many teachers are
disturbed, however, by the meager “language
training” afforded by this very brief re-telling.
Why not let the stories, by reiteration of them on
the teacher’s part, impose their thought process and
language mode on the forming habit of the child?
This does not mean that reproduction must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
verbatim repetition, nor that the children’s individuality
is to be suppressed. But what a mockery,
especially in some quarters, is this prevalent idea
in the schools that the child must not be familiarized
with the language of the story, but that he
should be compelled to “tell it in his own words.”
Alas, “his own words”! Would not familiarity
with the story’s language bring riches to the
thought-starved and language-starved children of
some unschooled parents, anxious that their children
shall enjoy advantages denied to themselves?
Would it not help in foreign sections?</p>

<p>(6) <i>It is partial re-telling.</i> Let the children
come into possession of the story naturally and
gradually. At each re-telling of it by yourself look
for firmer and fuller reproduction. Help to keep
the children’s interest centered in the story, not so
much by commenting patronizingly, “How well
John told the story!” but rather by openly enjoying
the story John is telling. Let language come, as it
should, with the effort to express the thought. And
do not interfere with composition by unnecessary
questioning. Your first method of helping the
pupils’ reproduction might be by supplying omitted
parts rather than by questioning analytically for
them, as is so commonly done at present. (Questioning
has of course its place: it serves to lift<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
into consciousness the relations existing among the
parts of the story.) Try co-operative telling: tell
part yourself, then let a child or several in succession
tell the next, helping if necessary but not
anticipating, and perhaps finish the story yourself.
The children will soon be able to manage more.
Simple, artistic illustrative picture or blackboard
sketches, showing in succession the main divisions
of the story, will help to give it uninterrupted sequence.
(When divisions are made either orally
or pictorially, they should be true portions of the
whole.) Presently the children will find themselves
telling the whole of some stories without
undue feeling of strain, and with great pleasure to
themselves and their classmates.</p>

<p>Is it natural, by the way, to reproduce in the
same company a story just heard? This is the
common school practice. In an adult audience this
would of course never be done except on the frank
basis of practice in so doing or for some other
accepted purpose. The children enjoy dwelling on
the story. And they may practice, with the motive
of telling the story at home. The teacher need not,
therefore, strain at devices to make reproduction
more natural, yet she might often take advantage
of or contrive more natural occasion for it. The
natural occasion is social intercourse and entertainment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
There is space only to indicate one or two
ways of securing this attractive natural motive.
Sometimes let at least a day elapse before asking for
the reproduction; you may then let the exercise be
an opportunity to enjoy the story again. Tell the
same story over and over (if it be a good one)
yourself on appropriate occasions, and encourage the
children to do the same thing. Let individuals, or
groups, or classes, visit and exchange stories.</p>

<p>(7) The child’s part, <i>telling similar stories</i> and
(8) <i>inventing</i> stories, should go without saying.
Do not neglect the opportunity offered by (8). If
you reduce the class to workable groups at a time
for this exercise, it should be practicable. Do not
press prematurely the creative imagination, but do
not neglect it. Give play to the natural working of
a little child’s fancy, the boy’s or girl’s, the youth’s
imagination. It is wise to follow the lead of the
child here, then be at hand, not to deprive the child
of the efficiency of independence and of the pleasure
of making, but to help when necessary that his
attempt may be encouragingly successful.</p>

<p>(9) <i>It is sometimes expressing story images in
other media.</i> Here, again, the adult will do well to
follow the lead of the child; of course of the most
freely expressive child. The inert must be stimulated.
Left to himself the child would not commit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
some of the excesses in sensible representation that
adults impose upon children, though objective representation
is natural to man at the childlike stage.
It is not necessary that the child represent materially
every set of language ideas. The teacher
should not, on the other hand, stop natural attempt
to represent even the more elusive kinds of ideas;
there may be a budding Watts or Chase in her
class, capable of picturing the highly fanciful and
spiritual.</p>

<p>Keep the exercise growing. Its aim is to give
constructive outlet to the child. The child’s conception
of the story, with expression of it and each
re-hearing, is growing. The practice of keeping a
child’s first attempts at expression in drawing or
modeling or cutting or his attempts at any one
stage too long about the classroom, before his eyes,
is dwarfing. There is, of course, the other side to
the question. To accept nothing as accomplishment
is deadening to effort. It is possible, however,
is it not, to meet the child on childlike standard
of achievement, to acknowledge the day’s accomplishment,
yet without disheartening him, or even
talking to him about the better things he will do,
to keep <i>our</i> own faces turned toward the morrow?</p>

<p>(10) <i>It is playing the stories.</i> This, if not done
with every story without discrimination, or without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
reference to the children’s instinctive selective
sense, if kept at least fairly spontaneous and progressive,
is a form of constructivity heartily enjoyed
by the children. It is wise here again to
follow the child’s lead. Let us understand, however,
by this the lead of the majority of our most
normal children and of the most gifted individuals.
Many children meager in imagination, feeble in
initiative, inadequate in execution, will need the
strong lead of other children or of the teacher,
qualified child seer from her experience with more
favored children. Let her give to these from her
abundance, becoming best playfellow and guide.
But let her keep herself in the attitude of <i>playing
with the children</i>.</p>

<p>Let us see how playing the story might develop.
As soon as the story takes possession of the child
he shows a tendency to enter into its persons and
its action; to mimic the voices, to ape the manners,
to do the doings. Give outlet to this; let the child
take on and play out the life of the story, or yourself
propose playing the story.</p>

<p>Do not, by the way, clutter up the child’s direct
outlet with staging and properties and stage terms.
It destroys spontaneity and reality. Let the schoolroom
be the place, and, as a rule, the school furnishings
any necessary things, and the school children,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
in their ordinary clothes, the people. The
delight of “dressing up” may sometimes be allowed;
but a mere suggestion in costume, if it be
something distinctive of the character impersonated,
is all that is necessary; a gold paper crown,
for example, will at once make a queen of any
child. Why not with the little children talk
simply and naturally: “Let us play” (not act nor
dramatize) so and so. Who’ll be so and so? I’ll
be so and so. Where will you have your home?
And so on. Do not at the beginning <i>press</i> even
this simple kind of planning; let the play develop
with the playing of it. Help the children, however,
gradually to gain in planning.</p>

<p>Playing has a tendency to make the form static;
it is a mistake to let this happen too soon. Do not,
as is the practice, stop telling the story yourself after
the children have once played it. You will find that
their intimate experience in playing it will bring a
more pointed attention to the next hearing of it, and
that their next playing will be richer in detail, or
stronger in structure, or truer in characterization,
or more appropriate in dialogue. Do not, of
course, keep the children on one story either for
playing or other form of reproduction until they
weary of it.</p>

<p>Far from deploring, by the way, the child’s crudities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
in dialogue, appreciate the opportunity to let
him express himself and to develop his language
sense. Keep the language way open to him. He
will catch the force of your comment on how some
character spoke, himself suggest to another pupil
what the person the pupil is impersonating should
say, note how you talk when you impersonate, or
how you respond in dialogue with him.</p>

<p>Playing the stories is open to educational abuse
by being turned into insincere show work. This
results, too, in exclusion of pupils who do not excel.
Keep playing the stories, at least for the little
children, the spontaneous universal thing they make
it—<i>play</i>. Their own selective sense guides them
in assigning or assuming rôles. It is abused, also,
by adult patronage. The teacher laughs at the
children rather than with them, or laughs when the
true child seer would be serious. The child thoroughly
enjoys playing the stories, but this does not
mean that he laughs constantly or at his own performance.
Encourage him to catch the fun or
humor of a situation or of a remark; enjoy the
playing openly when it is merry, laugh and laugh
heartily, but do not turn his genuine playing into a
sham. Do not, on the other hand, take him too
seriously; he does not always take himself so. In
short, get the child’s point of view here as elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>The “last’s the best of all the game;” it is
(11) <i>growing by the power and grace of the story</i>.</p>

<p>May the child nurtured on the wit and wisdom
of the simple story simply told live happy ever
after!</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Thus we arrived at this place together, where the people were
in the habit of spinning up the tow. It was an enforced custom
with them that each in turn should relate some little tale, or history,
and to tell the truth, not only the noble women, but also
myself and my friend, found our entire pleasure in such stories, and
we often used to stop old beggars and give them a trifle more for
telling us them.</p>

<h3>THE FAIRY HORSESHOE</h3>

<p>At midnight a long time ago an honest hard-working
blacksmith heard someone in his shop
hammering, hammering, hammering, for all the
world like another blacksmith making a shoe. But
the sound was very quick and light, more like tapping,
tapping, tapping. And all the time, whoever
it was was whistling the prettiest tune you ever
heard, and singing between times:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“I’m a cunning blacksmith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I can make a shoe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Heat the iron,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bend the iron,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hammer it true—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Il y ho, il y hoo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Il y ho, il y hoo—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I’m a cunning blacksmith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I can make a shoe.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The blacksmith listened and thought, and listened
and thought, and listened and thought. Then he
sprang out of bed on tiptoe, crying softly, “I have
it! I have it! It’s one of the wee small people.
I’ll catch him if I can for good luck.” The blacksmith
needed some good luck. His work was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
shoe the horse and shoe the colt and shoe the wild
mare; and he did it well. But he hadn’t enough
to do, and so he was very poor.</p>

<p>Well, to go back, the blacksmith sprang out of
bed on tiptoe. Then without making the least bit
of noise in the world that ever was heard, he opened
the door of his bedroom and looked all about the
shop. He couldn’t see sight nor light of anybody,
but he heard the hammering, and whistling, and the
singing between times:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“I’m a cunning blacksmith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I can make a shoe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Heat the iron,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bend the iron,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hammer it true—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Il y ho, il y hoo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Il y ho, il y hoo—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I’m a cunning blacksmith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I can make a shoe.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“It’s very odd,” said he, under his breath;
“where can the wee small thing be!” All of a
sudden, as he peered about more sharply, he spied
it stuck in the girth of a white mare standing in the
stall nearest the forge. The elfin smith was wearing
a bit of an apron before him, and a tid of a
nightcap on his head, and hammering away at a
speck of a horseshoe.</p>

<p>“He’ll bring me good luck, if I can only catch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
him,” said the blacksmith so softly that his own ears
could scarcely hear. And without making the least
bit of noise in the world that ever was heard, he tiptoed
up behind the wee small body, opened his hand,
and—snatched him up, crying, “Ha, ha, I have
you.” With that he opened two fingers to take a
look, when—out jumped the elf, crying, “Ho, ho,
see me go,” and away he did go like a streak of
lightning.</p>

<p>But he left the wee bit horseshoe in the blacksmith’s
hand. And it did bring him good luck, so
that ever after he had plenty to do. So many horses
and colts and wild mares came to be shod that he
had to build a larger shop with nine-and-seven stalls.</p>

<p>When the blacksmith died, he left the good luck
fairy horseshoe to his sons, and they left it to their
sons, and they left it to their sons; so that if they
haven’t lost it the blacksmith’s great, great, great,
great, great, great, great grandchildren have it yet.</p>

<h3>THE MOUSE AND THE SAUSAGE</h3>

<p>Once upon a time a little mouse and a little sausage,
who loved each other like sisters, decided to live
together. They planned it so that every day one
would go to walk in the fields, or to buy things in
the town, and the other would stay at home to keep
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>One day, when the little sausage had prepared
cabbage for dinner, the little mouse, who had come
back from town with a good appetite, enjoyed it
so heartily that she exclaimed: “How delicious the
cabbage is to-day, my dear!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” answered the little sausage, “that is because
I popped myself into the pot while it was
cooking.”</p>

<p>On the next day, when it was her turn to prepare
the meals, the little mouse said to herself: “Now
I will do as much for my friend as she did for me;
we shall have lentils for dinner, and I will jump into
the pot while they are boiling.” So she did, without
stopping to think that a simple sausage can do some
things not to be attempted by even the wisest mouse.</p>

<p>When the sausage came home, she found the
house lonely and silent. She called again and again,
“My little mouse! Mouse of my heart!” but no
one answered. Then she went to look at the lentils
boiling on the stove, and, alas! found within the
pot her good little friend, who had perished for love
of her. Poor mousie had stayed too long at her
cookery, and when she tried to climb out of the pot,
she had no longer the strength to do so.</p>

<p>The little sausage could never be consoled! That
is why to-day, when you put one in the pan or
on the gridiron, you will hear her weep and sigh,
“M-my p-poor m-mouse! Ah, m-my p-poor
m-mouse!”</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF THE LITTLE BOY AND THE LITTLE DOG</h3>

<p>There was a little boy and there was a little dog.
The two lived together and loved each other, and
where one went the other followed.</p>

<p>Now, all of a sudden, the little boy and his nurse
moved away to another city, far, far off. This
puzzled the little boy so much that for once he
forgot the little dog. When he remembered him,
it was the middle of the night. But, for all that, he
got up and waked his nurse to ask her where the
little dog could be. The nurse rubbed her sleepy
eyes and said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sleep now, my lamb, and wait till day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy little dog is on the way.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then she closed her eyes and straightway fell fast
asleep, and so there was nothing for the little boy
to do but to fall asleep, too.</p>

<p>At break of day the little boy was at the window
watching for the little dog. But alas! no little dog
came. When the little boy asked his nurse what
could be keeping the little dog, she said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Be patient, my lamb, ’tis but peep of day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy little dog is on the way.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well, the morning and the noon passed, and no
little dog came. The little boy grieved so that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
could neither eat nor play. At last when evening
began to darken, and still no little dog came, and
still the little boy watched at the window, the nurse
put on her bonnet and shawl and went out to find
the little lost dog.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before she was back with a dog
that looked something like the dear lost one, but
much thinner and quieter. When the little boy said
so to his nurse, she said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yes, poor doggie! But he came a long way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without bite or sup, a night and a day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give him, my lamb, a bowl of warm milk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And soon you’ll see him as sleek as silk.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The little boy ran and gave him the milk. When
the little dog had lapped up the milk, he felt so much
better that he licked the little boy’s face, and the
two frisked about the room.</p>

<p>But the little boy noticed that the little dog did
not caper so merrily as he used to do. Indeed, the
poor creature soon became quiet and sad again.
And, although the little boy made his own legs go
as fast as a windmill, he could not coax the little
dog to run a race with him. He saw, too, that the
little dog found it very hard to curl himself up on
the hearthrug for a nap. And the next day the
little dog was so wretched that he refused to
eat.</p>

<p>“Poor, poor doggie, what ails you, whatever ails<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
you?” cried the little boy. “You’ll die if you do
not eat.” He lifted the dog tenderly into his lap,
when—what should he feel on the stomach but a
seam! “Nurse,” he cried, “come quickly; something
is stitched so tight around the poor dog’s body
he cannot eat nor breathe.”</p>

<p>The nurse ran in with the scissors in her hand.
And lo!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With a nip and a snip, and snip and a nip,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And a very loud pip!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">out came the little boy’s own little dog.</p>

<p>“Now I see through it all,” cried the nurse. And
what she saw was what had really happened.</p>

<p>While the little dog was on his way to the little
boy, a dog-seller snatched him up and carried him
into a shop. There he tried to change him into a
French poodle by sewing him into a skin-tight black
jacket with curly trimming. But by great good
luck it was down the street past this very shop the
nurse walked and spied the little dog peeping out
to see how he might escape.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll never forget thee again,” cried the little
boy. And he didn’t. The two lived happy together
ever after, and where one went the other followed.</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF THE TWO CAKES WHO LOVED EACH OTHER IN SILENCE</h3>

<p>On the shop counter lay two gingerbread cakes.
One was the shape of a man with a hat, the other of
a maiden without a bonnet. Both their faces were
on the side that was turned up, for they were to be
looked at on that side, and not on the other. On
the left the man wore a bitter almond—that was
his heart. The maiden was honey-cake all over.</p>

<p>As they were only samples, they stayed on the
counter a long time. And, at last, they fell in love
with each other. But neither told the other, as
should have been done, if anything was to come
of it.</p>

<p>“He is a man and must speak first,” thought she.
But she was happy, for she knew he loved her.</p>

<p>His thoughts were far more extravagant; that
is the way with men. He dreamed that he was a
real street boy, and that he had four pennies of his
own, and that he bought the sweet maiden and ate
her up.</p>

<p>So they lay on the counter for weeks and weeks,
and grew dry and hard.</p>

<p>But the thoughts of the maiden became ever more
gentle and maidenly. “It is enough for me that I
have lived on the same table with him,” she said,
and—crack! she broke in two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“If she had only known of my love,” thought he,
“she would have kept together a little longer.”</p>

<p class="tb">“And that is their story, and here they are, both
of them,” said the baker, for it was he who was
telling the story. “They are remarkable for their
curious history, and for their silent love, which
never came to anything. There they are for you.”
So saying, he gave the man, who was yet whole, to
Joanna, and the broken maiden to Knud.</p>

<p>But the children were so impressed with the story
that they could only look at them, they could not
eat them up just yet.</p>

<h3>HOW THE ROOSTER BUILT A HOUSE OF HIS OWN</h3>

<p>One spring day a young rooster set out on his two
stout legs to build a house of his own. On he went,
a long, long way, and a long, long way farther, and
a long, long way farther than that.</p>

<p>Then he lifted up his voice and flapped his wings
and crowed,</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cock-a-doodle-doo.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At this out from somewhere stepped a bonny, wee
white hen and fared along beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>On went the young rooster and the bonny, wee
white hen a long, long way, and a long, long way
farther, and a long, long way farther than that.</p>

<p>Then the young rooster lifted up his voice, flapped
his wings, and crowed,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cock-a-doodle-doo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s room for a friend or two.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">At this out from somewhere stepped a bearded goat,
and a brindled cow, and a long-tailed horse, and a
whiskered cat, and fared along beside him.</p>

<p>On went the young rooster, and the bonny, wee
white hen, and the bearded goat, and the brindled
cow, and the long-tailed horse, and the whiskered
cat, a long, long way, and a long, long way farther,
and a long, long way farther than that.</p>

<p>Then the young rooster lifted up his voice, flapped
his wings, and crowed,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cock-a-doodle-doo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My friends, will this place do?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The bearded goat climbed up to browse on a rocky
hill near by, and said it would. The brindled cow
cropped the grass beside a running stream, and said
it would. The long-tailed horse took a mouthful
from a clump of wild oats, and said it would. The
whiskered cat spied a field mouse scurrying into her
hole, and said it would. The bonny, wee white hen
had not spoken. The rooster looked about for her,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
so did the bearded goat, and the brindled cow, and
the long-tailed horse, and the whiskered cat, but she
was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>The young rooster lifted up his voice, flapped his
wings, and crowed,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">cried the bonny, wee white hen, running out to
tell him of an egg she had laid in the long soft
hay.</p>

<p>“Well done,” cried Father Rooster, looking very
proud of her; “our peeping chicks will soon be out
of the shell.”</p>

<p>So then they all knew the place would do, and they
set about building the house of their own. The long-tailed
horse cut down a tree for wood with his strong
teeth, the bearded goat rubbed the edges smooth
with his horns, the brindled cow carried the beams
on her broad back and stood them up in place with
her forelegs, the whiskered cat sprang up and down
the beams and nailed them together, the young
rooster gave the orders to everyone, and when the
house was done the bonny, wee white hen swept it
clean as a new pin.</p>

<p>Then they all moved in. And there they lived in
this house of their own for a year and a day, and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
year and a day, and a great many more, as happy as
bees in clover.</p>

<p>And the young rooster was cock of the walk.</p>

<h3>THUMBELINA</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Arranged as a continued story</i>)</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">How She Came to the Woman</span></h4>

<p>Once a woman wished she had a very little child,
but she did not know where to get one. So she went
to an old witch and said, “I wish I had a very little
child. Can you tell me where I might get one?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that I can easily,” said the old witch. “Here
is a barleycorn for you. It is not the kind that
grows in everyone’s field and the chickens eat. Put
it into a flower pot, and you shall see what you shall
see.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the woman, and she gave the
witch twelve shillings, for that was the price of the
barleycorn.</p>

<p>Well, the woman planted the barleycorn. And
immediately there grew up a great handsome flower.
It was like a tulip, but the petals were tightly closed
as if it were still a bud.</p>

<p>“What a beautiful flower,” cried the woman,
and she kissed its yellow and red leaves. “Pop,”
the flower opened. It was a real tulip, but in
the middle, there upon the green velvet stamens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
sat a tiny maiden, lovely as a fairy, and only
half a thumb’s height. So her mother called her
Thumbelina.</p>

<p class="tb">And that is how she got her.</p>

<h3>THUMBELINA</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How She is Carried Off by the Toad</span></h4>

<p>One night as Thumbelina lay sleeping in her pretty
walnut-shell cradle, there came creeping through the
open window an old Toad. He hopped straight
down the table where Thumbelina lay.</p>

<p>“Ah, she would make a lovely wife for my son,”
said he. So he picked up the cradle with Thumbelina
in it, and hopped through the window and down the
garden to the brook. Here he lived with his son.</p>

<p>“What do you say to her for your bride, my
son?” said he.</p>

<p>“Croak! croak! brek-kek-kek!” was all the son
could say.</p>

<p>“Hush! Don’t speak so loudly, or she will
awake,” whispered the old Toad. “She might run
away from us, for she is as light as swan’s down.
We will put her out in the brook on one of the broad
lily leaves; that will be just like an island to her,
and she won’t be able to get away. Then we’ll go
and get the best room in the marsh in order, where
you are to live and keep house together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>So they swam out with her, and when they came
to a broad lily leaf lifted her out of the cradle very
gently without waking her, and swam back with it,
because they intended to place it in the bridal room.</p>

<p>Well, when Thumbelina woke and saw where she
was she began to cry bitterly, for there was water
on every side of the great leaf and she could not get
to land at all. The little fishes swimming below stuck
their heads out of the water to see what was the
matter. And when they saw Thumbelina they
thought her so pretty that they drew in their heads
and put them together under the water, and nibbled
away at the stem until the leaf was free. Then away
sailed Thumbelina, far off from the ridiculous toad
and his son who could only say, “Croak, croak,
brek-kek-kek.”</p>

<p>Thumbelina sailed by many cities, and the little
birds who sat in the bushes saw her, and said, “What
a lovely little girl!” A white butterfly fluttered
round her and at last alighted on the leaf with her.
Thumbelina was glad of his company; she took her
girdle and tied one end of it around the butterfly and
the other to the leaf. On she went, faster than ever
now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>Soon there came a big May-bug flying toward her.
When he saw her he thought her so pretty he clasped
his claws round her waist, and flew with her up into
a tree.</p>

<p>Mercy! how frightened poor little Thumbelina
was! But the May-bug did her no harm. He seated
himself with her upon the biggest green leaf of the
tree, gave her the sweet part of the flowers to eat,
and told her she was lovely, although she did not
look a bit like a May-bug.</p>

<p>When the other May-bugs who lived in the tree
heard of it, they all came to pay a visit. They looked
at Thumbelina, and one said, “Why, she hasn’t
more than two legs; how very odd that is!”</p>

<p>“And she hasn’t any feelers!” cried another.</p>

<p>“How squeezed she is at the waist—fie! How
ugly she is!” said all the lady May-bugs.</p>

<p>So at last the May-bug who had carried her off
thought so, too, although she was really very pretty;
and he flew down with her from the tree and set her
on a daisy and left her there.</p>

<p>But, anyway, she was on land again; that was
something.</p>

<h3>THUMBELINA</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How She Goes to Live with the Field-Mouse</span></h4>

<p>The whole summer through Thumbelina lived quite
alone in the great wood. She wove herself a bed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
out of blades of grass, and hung it up under a shamrock
to be sheltered from the rain. She scooped
the honey out of the flowers for food, and she drank
the dew that stood every morning on the leaves.
So summer and autumn passed.</p>

<p>Now came the winter, the long cold winter. All
the sweet birds who used to sing to her flew away.
The trees and flowers lost their leaves. The great
shamrock she lived under shriveled up, and left her
shivering. She tried to wrap herself in a dry leaf,
but that tore in the middle. Soon it began to snow.
Every snowflake that fell on her was like a whole
shovelful thrown on us, for we are tall and she was
only an inch high. Poor little Thumbelina! she was
nearly frozen!</p>

<p>She wandered out of the wood into a withered
cornfield. The corn had gone long ago; nothing but
dry stubble stood up out of the frozen ground. But
it was like a great forest for Thumbelina to be lost
in. How she trembled with the cold!</p>

<p>After some time she came to a field-mouse’s home.
It was in a little hole under the corn stubble, warm
and cosy. There was a kitchen in it and a pantry
filled with corn. Little Thumbelina stood at the
door just like a poor beggar girl and begged for a
little bit of barleycorn. “I haven’t eaten a crumb
in two days,” she cried pitifully.</p>

<p>“You poor little creature,” said the kind field-mouse,
“come into my warm kitchen and eat as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
much as you wish.” And when Thumbelina came
in, the field-mouse liked her so well that she said,
“If you wish you may stay with me all winter,
but you must keep my room clean and neat,
and tell me little stories, for I am very fond of
them.”</p>

<p>So Thumbelina did, and had a very good time
of it.</p>

<h3>THUMBELINA</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How She Meets the Mole</span></h4>

<p>One day when Thumbelina had tidied the house and
made it look as neat as a new pin, she sat down to
chat with the field-mouse.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said the field-mouse, “we shall soon
have a visit from my neighbor, the mole. He comes
to see me once a week. Do you know, he would
make you a good husband. He is rich. He lives
in a much larger house than mine, and wears beautiful
black velvet fur. When he comes you must tell
him the prettiest stories you know.”</p>

<p>And, sure enough, the mole came to see them,
dressed in his black velvet fur. Thumbelina did not
care for him at all. He talked about nothing but
himself. He told how rich he was and how large his
rooms were, twenty times larger than the field-mouse’s,
and he said he didn’t like the sun and
flowers, just because he had never seen them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“How can you talk so!” cried Thumbelina,
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Sing us one of your sweet songs, Thumbelina,
my dear,” said the field-mouse.</p>

<p>So Thumbelina had to sing. She sang, “Ladybug,
fly away.” She sang it so sweetly that the mole
fell in love with her. But he did not tell her so yet.
As for her, she was glad when his visit was over.</p>

<h3>THUMBELINA</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How She Takes Care of the Swallow</span></h4>

<p>Well, the mole had dug a long passage through the
earth from his house to the field-mouse’s, and he told
Thumbelina and the field-mouse they might walk in
the passage whenever they chose.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid of the dead bird lying there,”
said he; “come with me and I’ll show you where
it is.” He led the way with a bit of rotted wood
in his mouth to light up the long dark passage.
When he came to the place, he thrust his broad nose
through the ceiling to make a hole so that the daylight
might shine down. And there in the middle
of the floor lay a dead swallow, with his beautiful
wings pressed close against his sides and his feet
and head drawn in under the feathers. The poor
thing looked as if he had died of cold.</p>

<p>Thumbelina was very sorry for him, but the mole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
gave the bird a push with his crooked legs and said,
“Now he can’t pipe any more. I’m glad I was not
born a bird, and that none of my children can ever
be birds. A bird can do nothing but say ‘tweet
tweet’ in summer and starve in winter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” cried the field-mouse, “you may
well say you are better off to be a mole. You are
clever, you can build and make underground passages
where you may keep snug and warm in the
winter. Of what use is all this ‘tweet tweet’ to a
bird when the frost comes?”</p>

<p>But Thumbelina did not agree with them at all.
When they turned their backs on the bird she bent
down, gently moved the feathers aside, and kissed
him on the closed eyes.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she thought, “it was this very bird
that sang so sweetly to me in the wood. He did far
more for me than the mole does. How much pleasure
he gave me, the dear, beautiful bird!”</p>

<p>The mole now closed up the hole and escorted the
ladies home.</p>

<p>But that night Thumbelina could not sleep for
thinking of the dead bird. So she got out of her
bed and wove a soft blanket of hay. She carried
this out into the dark passage and spread it over the
poor bird. As she did so she laid her hand on the
bird’s heart. It was beating! He was not dead at
all! only numb with cold.</p>

<p>When he grew warm through and through he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
opened his eyes and looked at Thumbelina. At first
she trembled, she was so frightened, for the bird was
very large to her, who was only an inch in height.
But she was too kind to run away from him.</p>

<p>“Thank you, pretty child,” said the sick swallow
in a weak voice. “Now that I am warm I shall get
strong again and be able to fly on my way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, stay where you are,” said Thumbelina, “it
is so cold outside. It snows and freezes. Stay in
your warm bed and I will nurse you.”</p>

<p>She brought the swallow water in the petal of a
flower. When he had drunk he told her all about
himself. He had set out for the south, the warm
countries, with the other swallows; but as he flew
he caught one of his wings in a thorn bush and tore
it. After this he could not fly so fast as the others,
so the winter overtook him and he could not stand
the cold. It benumbed him so that he fell to the
ground. He could remember nothing more after
this, until he opened his eyes and found Thumbelina
at his side.</p>

<p>The whole winter Thumbelina nursed the swallow.
And when the spring came and the sun was warm,
she opened the hole in the ceiling and let the sunshine
pour in on him.</p>

<p>“I am strong enough now to fly out into the sunshine,”
said the swallow. “Sit on my back and let
us fly far into the green wood.”</p>

<p>But Thumbelina would not do this; she knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
that the old field-mouse would be lonely without
her.</p>

<p>“No, I cannot,” said she.</p>

<p>“Farewell then, you pretty, good child,” said the
swallow, and he flew off into the sunshine. Thumbelina
looked after him, and the tears came into her
eyes, she was so sorry to part with him.</p>

<p>“Tweet-tweet,” he sang, as she lost sight of him
in the green wood.</p>

<h3>THUMBELINA</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How She is Helped by the Swallow</span></h4>

<p>“My dear,” said the field-mouse one day after the
mole had paid her a visit, “the mole has asked me
to give you to him for his wife. You are very fortunate,
a poor child like you. You must be ready to
marry him as soon as possible. Set to work at once
on your wedding-dress.”</p>

<p>So Thumbelina had to turn the spindle to make
herself not only a wedding-dress but plenty of wool
and linen, for the field-mouse said she would not
have her go to the mole empty-handed, as if she
were a beggar-girl. And the mole himself hired
four spiders to weave her a beautiful cobweb veil.
And every evening he paid her a visit, and said they
must be married as soon as the summer was over.</p>

<p>Poor Thumbelina did not know what to do. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
did not wish to marry the mole, and live under the
ground, where the sun never shone. The first thing
every morning and the last every evening, she crept
outdoors, and when the wind blew the corn leaves
apart, she looked up at the sky and wished the
swallow would come to her. But he did not.</p>

<p>When autumn came, Thumbelina had everything
ready.</p>

<p>“Only four weeks more for the wedding,” cried
the mole.</p>

<p>But when he had gone home Thumbelina wept
and said she could not marry the ugly mole, who
talked about nothing but himself.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said the field-mouse, “don’t be obstinate,
or I’ll bite you with my sharp teeth. The
Queen herself has not such black velvet fur. And
his kitchen and cellar are full. Be thankful for your
good fortune.”</p>

<p>Well, the wedding day arrived. The mole, dressed
in his best black velvet, came to fetch Thumbelina
to his house.</p>

<p>“Farewell, thou bright sun!” she cried, running
out of the house a little way. “Farewell,” she cried,
twining her arms around a little red flower still
blooming there; “say farewell to the little swallow
for me, if you see him again.”</p>

<p>“Tweet-tweet! tweet-tweet!” suddenly sounded
over her head. She looked up; it was the little
swallow, just flying by. He stopped when he saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
Thumbelina, he was so glad. And Thumbelina told
him how she was to marry the mole, and live deep
under the earth, where the sun never shone. She
could not help weeping as she told of it.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said the swallow, “I am on my
way far off to the warm countries. Sit on my back,
and we will fly from the ugly mole and his dark
room. Only fly with me, you dear little Thumbelina,
who were so good to me when I lay frozen in the
dark passage.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Thumbelina, “I will go with you.”
And she seated herself on the bird’s back, and bound
her girdle to one of his strongest feathers. Then
the swallow flew up into the air and away over
forest and sea and great high mountains, where the
snow always lies, and on, on, on to the beautiful
warm countries.</p>

<h3>THUMBELINA</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">What Became of Her at Last</span></h4>

<p>In the warm countries the sun shone so bright that
in the ditches and on the hedges grew big juicy blue
and green grapes, lemons and oranges hung in the
woods, and the loveliest children ran about the
roads chasing gorgeous butterflies. The swallow
flew on until he came to a great palace with dazzling
white marble pillars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“My house is at the top of one of those pillars,”
said he, “but it is not good enough for you. It is
not yet so well furnished as I should like it to be if
you were to live in it. Pick out one of the splendid
flowers you see down there, and I will set you down
in it.”</p>

<p>“That will be a beautiful home,” cried Thumbelina,
and clapped her hands. She chose a great
white flower. The swallow flew down with her and
set her on one of the broad leaves. What was
Thumbelina’s surprise? There in the flower sat a
little man, shining white, with a tiny gold crown
on his head, and bright wings on his shoulders; and
he wasn’t a bit bigger than Thumbelina herself.</p>

<p>“How handsome he is!” whispered she to the
swallow.</p>

<p>“That is the king of all the flowers,” whispered
the swallow back to her.</p>

<p>The little king was afraid of the big swallow, but
he liked Thumbelina the minute he saw her. She
was the prettiest maiden he had ever laid eyes on.
Instantly he took off his golden crown and put it
on her head, asked her name, and begged her to be
his wife and queen of all the flowers.</p>

<p>Now of course such a husband was much better
than the toad’s son who could say nothing from
morning till night but “Croak, croak, brek-kek-brek;”
and the field-mouse’s neighbor, the mole,
who could do nothing from morning till night but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
talk of himself. So Thumbelina said “Yes,” with
a right good will, to the charming Prince.</p>

<p>And out of every flower came a lady or lord,
lovely to behold, and each brought Thumbelina a
wedding present. But the best gift was a pair of
beautiful wings that had once belonged to a great
white fly. When these had been fastened on her by
one of the lovely ladies, Thumbelina could fly from
flower to flower, and visit everyone in her kingdom.</p>

<p>It was a joyful wedding. The little swallow sat
above them in the nest,—he was to sing the marriage-song.
And although his heart was sad to lose
Thumbelina, he sang it sweetly.</p>

<p>So that is the end, and Thumbelina lived happy
ever after.</p>

<h3>A VISIT FROM AN ELF</h3>

<p>One evening, as a farmer was crossing a field to his
home, what should he see sitting on a stone in the
middle of it but a tiny creature! The little thing
looked something like a very, very, very small, teeny,
weeny, tiny little child. And it was blue and shivering
with cold. The farmer saw that it must be an elf.</p>

<p>He knew it would bring him good luck to be kind
to it. Besides, he pitied it from his heart. So he
took it home and placed it on a stool by the hearth,
and fed it with sweet milk. Soon the bantling was
warm and lively. He capered and sprang about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
kitchen merrier than a cricket, and twice as light-footed.</p>

<p>Well, he didn’t go the next day nor the next nor
the next. He stayed for many days. A curious
thing about him was that he never spoke. But that
did not matter, for he kept the farmer and the
farmer’s wife laughing at his tricks.</p>

<p>He and they had many a play together. Sometimes,
when the farmer’s wife was not looking, he
would creep into the keyhole. Then the farmer
would call out, “Find him, wife.”</p>

<p>At this the farmer’s wife would search all about
the kitchen, under the chairs, in the closet, behind
the wood box, even in the clock case. But
she could not find him. Then she would cry out,
“Where are you, Tinykins?”</p>

<p>The farmer would chuckle and hee-haw, and slap
his knee, and wink, and say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He’s neither in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he’s neither out;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’s where something goes in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the light goes out.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Quick as the crow flies before the farmer’s empty
gun the farmer’s wife would guess, “You’re in the
keyhole, Tinykins, you rogue, come out.”</p>

<p>And out he would pop in high glee.</p>

<p>The way he went was as strange as the way he
came. I’ll tell you about it</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>One evening as the little fellow was frisking about
the farm kitchen, a shrill voice from the farmyard
called three times, “Tolman Grig! Tolman Grig!
Tolman Grig!”</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho! My daddy is come,” cried the elf,
springing up and speaking for the first time.</p>

<p>With that, off he flew through the keyhole.</p>

<p>That was the last the farmer or his wife ever saw
of him. But forever after they were happy and
prosperous.</p>

<h3>HOW THE CAT GOT ALL THE GRAIN</h3>

<p>Once upon a time a Cat and a Parrot owned a field
together. One day the Cat said to the Parrot,
“Come, friend, ’tis time to till the field.”</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, “I can’t come now, because I
am whetting my bill on the branch of a mango-tree.”</p>

<p>So the Cat went alone and plowed the field.
When it was plowed the Cat went again to the
Parrot and said, “Come, friend, let us sow the
corn.”</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, “I can’t come now, because I
am whetting my bill on the branch of a mango-tree.”</p>

<p>So the Cat went alone and sowed the corn. The
corn took root, and sprouted, and put forth the
blade, and the ear, and the ripe corn in the ear.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
Then the Cat went again to the Parrot and said,
“Come, friend, let us go and gather in the harvest.”</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, “I can’t come now, because I am
whetting my bill on the branch of a mango-tree.”</p>

<p>So the Cat went alone and gathered in the harvest.
She put it away in barns and made ready for
the threshing. Then she went again to the Parrot
and said, “Come, friend, let us winnow the grain
from the chaff.”</p>

<p>Said the Parrot, “I can’t come now, because I
am whetting my bill on the branch of a mango-tree.”</p>

<p>So the Cat went alone and winnowed the grain
from the chaff. Then she went again to the Parrot
and said, “Come, friend, the grain is all winnowed
and sifted. Come and let us divide it between
us.”</p>

<p>“I will,” shrieked the Parrot so loudly that he
lost his balance, fell from the branch of the mango-tree,
and cracked open his poll. That put an end to
him. So the Cat had all the grain for herself.</p>

hump or two.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the chicks and the ducklings and
the little turkeys and the goslings.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“It was—alive!” said the stork, opening his
eyes and his mouth up so high that he could hardly
get them down again.</p>

<p>“Ah, it wasn’t a real ship at all,” whispered the
chicks to the ducklings, and they whispered it to
the little turkeys, and they whispered it to the
goslings.</p>

<p>“It was a camel,” said the stork.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the chicks, the ducklings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
the little turkeys, and the goslings. And they
crowded around him.</p>

<p>“He’s called the ship of the desert,” said the
stork. And he drew back to see what they thought
of it.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the chicks, the ducklings, the
little turkeys, and the goslings.</p>

<p>“Ask your teacher,” said he, flying off to his
nest in the chimney top;</p>

<p>At this minute, by great good luck, they heard
Nan say to Ned, her brother, “Let’s play school.
I’ll be the teacher.” So they went to school.</p>

<p>And by great good luck Ned’s lesson was about
camels. “I’m not at all surprised,” whispered the
smallest chick to the biggest gosling; “I found a
four-leaf clover in the grass this morning. I knew
then we should have good luck.”</p>

<p>They listened with all their might to the lesson,
and when they found it too hard they stopped listening
to talk it over. This was pretty often. So
when they went home they knew as much about
camels as the stork does, and maybe as much as
you know.</p>

<h3>THE CLEVER GEESE</h3>

<p>A long, long time ago when there were more foxes’
dens than cats’ cradles, there lived a very sly fox.
Every evening this sly fox sneaked up through the
tall grass and weeds and around the tree-trunks,
pounced upon a plump young goose, and carried it
off to his den.</p>

<p>First, he had one hidden away, then two, then
three, then four, then five, then six, and by and
by as many more.</p>

<p>Well, when he had a round dozen, he called them
before him in a circle, fixed them with his bold
sharp eyes, and said, “My dumplings, prepare to die.
At moonlight, to-night, I dine on young goose.”</p>

<p>“You’ll surely give us time to say good-by,”
cried the poor simpletons, who suddenly turned
clever to save their necks. “We have become the
dearest of friends.”</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” said the fox, with a bow.
“Take as much time as you like, my dainties, for
the sweet parting.” And off he went.</p>

<p>One silly goose began to giggle at their cleverness
before he was out of earshot. But her sisters ran
at her and pecked her into silence. They laughed
with their eyes only, and so long as the fox kept
walking away and not looking back that was perfectly
safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Well, at moonlight, sure enough, the fox came
home to dine. And at once the geese began to say
good-by.</p>

<p>“Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-” said one. And when he
stopped for breath, “Ga-ga-ga-ga-” said another.
And, when he stopped, another took it up. And
after that, another and another.</p>

<p>So, for all I know, they are at it still. The fox
has not yet dined, and the geese are alive and gabbling,
though, as the story says at the beginning, it
all happened a very long time ago, before any of us
were born.</p>

<h3>THE HAPPY PRINCE</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Especially suitable in winter season</i>)</p>

<p>High above the city, on a tall column, stood the
statue of the Happy Prince. He was gilded all over
with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two
bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on
his sword-hilt.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you be like the Happy Prince?”
asked a mother of her little boy who was crying for
the moon. “The Happy Prince never dreams of
crying for anything.”</p>

<p>“I am glad there is some one in the world who
is quite happy,” muttered a disappointed man as he
gazed at the wonderful statue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“He looks just like an angel,” said the Orphan
Children, as they came out of the cathedral.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” said the Mathematical
Master, “you have never seen one.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but we have, in our dreams,” answered
the children; and the Mathematical Master
frowned and looked very severe, for he did not
approve of dreaming.</p>

<p>One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.
His friends had gone away to Egypt six
weeks before, but he had stayed behind with the
beautiful Reed. He had seen her early in the
spring as he was flying down the river after a big
yellow moth, and had stopped to talk to her.</p>

<p>“Shall I love you?” said he. “Shall I love
you?” And the Reed made him a low bow. So he
flew round and round her, touching the water with
his wings, and making silver ripples. This lasted
through the summer.</p>

<p>Then, when the autumn came, the other swallows
all flew away. After they had gone he felt
lonely.</p>

<p>“I am off to the Pyramids,” said he to the Reed.
“Good-by!” and he flew after them.</p>

<p>All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived
at the city. “Where shall I put up?” he
said; “I hope the town has made preparations.”</p>

<p>Then he saw the statue on the tall column.</p>

<p>“I will put up there,” he cried; “it is a high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
place with plenty of fresh air.” So he alighted
just between the feet of the Happy Prince.</p>

<p>“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to
himself as he looked round and prepared to go
to sleep; but as he was putting his head under
his wing a large drop of water fell on him. “What
a curious thing!” he cried; “there is not a single
cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and
bright, and yet it is raining. The climate in the
north of Europe is really dreadful.”</p>

<p>Then another drop fell.</p>

<p>“What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep
the rain off?” he said; “I must look for a good
chimney-pot,” and he made up his mind to fly away.</p>

<p>But before he had opened his wings, a third drop
fell, and he looked up and saw—Ah! what did
he see?</p>

<p>The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with
tears, and tears were running down his golden
cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight
that the little Swallow was filled with pity.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he said.</p>

<p>“I am the Happy Prince.”</p>

<p>“Why are you weeping then?” asked the Swallow.
“You have quite drenched me.”</p>

<p>“When I was alive and had a heart to feel,” answered
the statue, “I lived in a palace. In the
daytime I played with my companions in the garden,
and in the evening I led the dance in the Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
Hall. Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but
I never cared to ask what lay beyond it. My courtiers
called me the Happy Prince. So I lived and
died. And now that I am dead they have set me
up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and
all the misery of my city, and though my heart is
made of lead, yet I cannot choose but weep.”</p>

<p>“What! is he not solid gold?” said the Swallow
to himself. He was too polite to make any
personal remarks out loud.</p>

<p>“Far away,” continued the statue, “far away in
a little street there is a poor house. One of the
windows is open, and through it I can see a woman
seated at a table. Her face is thin and worn, and
she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle,
for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering flowers
on a satin gown for the loveliest of the queen’s
maids-of-honor to wear at the next court-ball. In
a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is
lying ill. He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.
His mother has nothing to give him but river
water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little
Swallow, will you not take her the ruby out of my
sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal
and I cannot move.”</p>

<p>“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.
“My friends are flying up and down the Nile.”</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the
Prince, “will you not stay with me for one night,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty, and
the mother so sad.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.
“Last summer, when I was staying on the
river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons,
who were always throwing stones at me. They
never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too
well for that, and besides, I come of a family
famous for its swiftness; but still it was a mark of
disrespect.”</p>

<p>But the Happy Prince looked so sad that the
little Swallow was sorry. “It is very cold here,”
he said; “but I will stay with you for one night
and be your messenger.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, little Swallow,” said the Prince.</p>

<p>So the Swallow picked out the great ruby from
the Prince’s sword, and flew away with it in his
beak over the roofs of the town.</p>

<p>He passed by the cathedral tower, where the
white marble angels were sculptured. He passed
by the palace and heard a beautiful girl say, “I
hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball.
I have ordered flowers to be embroidered on
it; but the seamstresses are so lazy.”</p>

<p>At last he came to the poor house and looked in.
The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the
mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. In he
hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside
the woman’s thimble. Then he flew gently round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his wings.
“How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting
better;” and he sank into a delicious slumber.</p>

<p>Then the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince.
“It is strange,” he remarked, “but I feel quite
warm now, although it is so cold.”</p>

<p>“That is because you have done a good action,”
said the Prince. And the little Swallow began to
think, and then he fell asleep. Thinking always
made him sleepy.</p>

<p>When day broke he flew down to the river and
had a bath. “What a remarkable phenomenon,”
said the Bird Professor as he was passing over the
bridge. “A swallow in winter!” And he wrote
a long letter about it to the local newspaper.</p>

<p>“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow,
and he was in high spirits. He visited all the public
monuments, and sat a long time on top of the
church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows
chirruped, and said to each other, “What a distinguished
stranger!” so he enjoyed himself very
much.</p>

<p>When the moon rose he flew back to the Happy
Prince. “Have you any commissions for Egypt?”
he cried; “I am just starting.”</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the
Prince, “will you not stay with me one night
longer?”</p>

<p>“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
“To-morrow my friends will fly up to the
Second Cataract. The river-horse couches there
among the bulrushes. At noon the lions come down
to the water’s edge to drink. They have eyes like
green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar
of the cataract.”</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the
Prince, “far away across the city I see a young man
in a garret. He is leaning over a desk covered with
papers. He is trying to finish a play, but he is
too cold to write any more. There is no fire in the
grate, and hunger has made him faint.”</p>

<p>“I will wait with you one night longer,” said the
Swallow, who really had a good heart. “Shall I
take him another ruby?”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that
I have left. But they are made of rare sapphires,
brought out of India a thousand years ago. Pluck
out one of them and take it to him. He will sell it
to the jeweler, and buy food and firewood, and
finish his play.”</p>

<p>“Dear Prince,” said the Swallow, “I cannot do
that;” and he began to weep.</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the
Prince, “do as I command you.”</p>

<p>So the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and
flew away to the student’s garret. It was easy
enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof.
Through this he darted, and came into the room.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
The young man had his head buried in his hands,
so he did not hear the flutter of the bird’s wings,
and when he looked up he found the beautiful
sapphire.</p>

<p>“Now I can finish my play,” he cried, and he
looked quite happy.</p>

<p>The next day the Swallow flew down to the
harbor. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and
watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the
hold with ropes. “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted
as each chest came up. “I am going to Egypt,”
cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when
the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.</p>

<p>“I am come to bid you good-by,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the
Prince, “will you not stay with me one night
longer?”</p>

<p>“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the
chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is
warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles
lie in the mud. My companions are building a nest.
Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never
forget you, and next spring I will bring you back
two beautiful jewels in place of those you have
given away. The ruby shall be redder than a red
rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great
sea.”</p>

<p>“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince,
“there stands a little match-girl. She has let her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled.
Her father will beat her if she does not take home
some money, and she is crying. She has no shoes
or stockings, and her little head is bare. Pluck
out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father
will not beat her.”</p>

<p>“I will stay with you one night longer,” said the
Swallow, “but I cannot pluck out your eye. You
would be quite blind then.”</p>

<p>“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the
Prince, “do as I command you.”</p>

<p>So he plucked out the Prince’s other eye, and
darted down with it. He swooped past the match-girl,
and slipped the jewel into the palm of her
hand. “What a lovely bit of glass!” cried the little
girl; and she ran home, laughing.</p>

<p>Then the Swallow came back to the Prince.
“You are blind now,” he said, “so I will stay with
you always.”</p>

<p>“No, little Swallow,” said the poor Prince, “you
must go away to Egypt.”</p>

<p>“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow,
and he slept at the Prince’s feet.</p>

<p>All the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder,
and told him stories of what he had seen in strange
lands. He told him of the red ibises, who stand in
long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish
in their beaks; and of the Sphinx, who is as old
as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and
knows everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you
tell me of marvelous things, but fly over my city,
little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.”</p>

<p>So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw
the rich making merry in their beautiful houses,
while the beggars were sitting at the gates. He
flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of
starving children looking out listlessly at the black
streets. Under the archway of a bridge two little
boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and
keep themselves warm. “How hungry we are!”
they said. “You must not lie here,” shouted the
Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.</p>

<p>Then he flew back and told the Prince what he
had seen.</p>

<p>“I am covered with fine gold,” said the Prince,
“you must take it off, leaf by leaf, and give it to
my poor.”</p>

<p>Leaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow
picked off, till the Happy Prince looked quite dull
and gray. Leaf after leaf of the fine gold he took
to the poor. “We have bread now!” they cried.
And the children’s faces grew rosier, and they
laughed and played games in the street.</p>

<p>Then the snow came, and after the snow came
the frost. The streets looked as if they were made
of silver, they were so bright and glistening; long
icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the
eaves of the houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>The poor little Swallow grew colder and colder,
but he would not leave the Prince; he loved him
too well. He picked up crumbs outside the baker’s
door, and tried to keep himself warm by flapping
his wings.</p>

<p>But at last he knew that he was going to die.
He had just strength to fly up to the Prince’s
shoulder once more. “Good-by, dear Prince!”
he murmured. “Will you let me kiss your
hand?”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you are going to Egypt at
last, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you have
stayed too long here; but kiss me on the lips, for I
love you.”</p>

<p>“It is not to Egypt that I am going,” said the
Swallow. “I am going to Death. Death is the
brother of Sleep, is he not?”</p>

<p>And he kissed the happy Prince on the lips, and
fell down dead at his feet.</p>

<p>At that moment a curious crack sounded inside
the statue, as if something had broken. The fact
is that the leaden heart had snapped in two. It
certainly was a hard frost.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the Mayor was walking
in the square below in company with the Town
Councilors. As they passed the column he looked
up at the statue. “Dear me! how shabby the
Happy Prince looks!” he said.</p>

<p>“How shabby indeed!” cried the Town Councilors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
who always agreed with the Mayor, and
they went up to look at it.</p>

<p>“The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes
are gone,” said the Mayor; “in fact, he is little
better than a beggar!”</p>

<p>So they pulled down the statue of the Happy
Prince and sent it to be melted in a furnace.</p>

<p>“What a strange thing!” said the overseer of
the workmen at the foundry. “This broken lead
heart will not melt in the furnace. We must throw
it away.” So they threw it on a dust-heap where
the dead Swallow was also lying.</p>

<p>“Bring me the two precious things in the city,”
said God to one of His Angels; and the Angel took
Him the leaden heart and the dead bird.</p>

<p>“You have chosen rightly,” said God; “in my
garden of Paradise this little bird shall sing for
evermore, and in my city of gold the Happy Prince
shall praise me.”</p>

<h3>THE DWARF ROOTS’ STORY OF THE PUMPKIN SEED</h3>

<p>Did you ever hear the story of the Pumpkin Seed
that made a feast of his insides, and found his outsides
changed most surprisingly, and went down a
pig’s throat and was happy? Ever since it happened
the Dwarf Roots, who live below the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
tell it to the pumpkin seeds. They say they heard
it from the wind one day when the farmer’s spade
laid the ground open and let the wind in. And the
wind says he heard the farm children’s grandmother
tell it. And she says she heard it from her
grandmother. So you see it is an old story, and
time you heard it. Then</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Throw the nuts in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let us straight begin.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before the Dwarf Roots tell the story they stroke
their beards that have grown fast into the ground,
like hairy threads, and cry out, “Once upon a,
twice upon a, thrice upon a time;” and all the
little pumpkin seeds lying low in the ground know
a story is coming and swell with joy. After that
the Dwarf Roots tell the story as ’twas told to
me. So</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Throw the nuts in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And turn the first about.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And let’s not stop again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Until the tale is out.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here’s the tale.</p>

<p>Early in the spring, when things with legs all
walk abroad and garden folks are born, a little
Pumpkin Seed stuck his head above ground. He
arrived with his cap on, as pumpkin seeds do, but
as soon as possible he shook it off, and looked about
him to find out what to do next. And who should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
he see come trotting down the garden path toward
him but a little sniffing, squealing pig, poking his
snout into everything and gobbling it up!</p>

<p>Now, how he came to know it the little Pumpkin
Seed never could tell, but all of a sudden he sang
out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m for your betters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Not you, piggy wig,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When juicy I’ve grown</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And round and big;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I’ll change into something</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which winks and blinks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with boys and girls</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Plays high jinks;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when I’m out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Snip, snap, snout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You may have me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It’s your turn to shout.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little pig was so astonished that he stood
straight up on his hind legs and curled his tail in
a tight knot, for all the world as if he were a performing
pig in a circus. When he was firm on his
legs again, he was just going to open his mouth,
when he saw the farmer coming down the path, so
he ran squealing from the garden. Some Dwarf
Roots who tell the story say he was going to gobble
up the little Pumpkin, and others say he was going
to answer in pig’s rhyme:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When it’s time to shout,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With my sniffy snout</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll smell you out.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>However that may be, the next time he came
trotting that way he poked his snout into a wire
netting the farmer had put around the kitchen
garden to keep him out, so that was the last the
little Pumpkin Seed saw of him for many a long
day.</p>

<p>But the Pumpkin Seed knew now what he should
do. He stood up straight in the sunlight and soft
rain, and grew and grew and covered himself with
blossoms, and then let them all drop off except one.
And out of that he made a little pumpy pumpkin,
and by harvest time he had that so fat and round
and yellow and juicy that the Dwarf Roots’ mouths
water when they tell of it.</p>

<p>The farmer gathered the Pumpkin in a great
basket, and his wife scooped out the splendid insides
of it and made of them deep rich pies for the
Thanksgiving feast that the farmer’s family eat
together in thankfulness to God for health and
plenty. Everyone comes to the feast: grandfather
and grandmother and uncles and aunts and all the
children, first cousins and second cousins and third
cousins and fourth cousins and fifth cousins, down
to the littlest babies that can do nothing, when
they’re not feeding and sleeping, but gurgle and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
crow at their fingers and toes. To be sure, when
the grown-ups bite into the deep rich pumpkin pie
they can do nothing either but gurgle and smack
their lips.</p>

<p>So it was that the inside of the Pumpkin did its
part and made a feast and came to glory.</p>

<p>But what of the outside? You shall hear. It
happened that very night.</p>

<p>The outside fell into the hands of a boy who could
work surprising changes in things. He worked one
in the outside of the Pumpkin. Some Dwarf Roots
say he turned it into a Jack-o’-lantern, and some say
into a goblin. Anyway, there it was that night,
stuck in the farmer’s hitching-post and changed most
surprisingly. It had a head that glowed like fire in
the darkness, and big round eyes that winked and
blinked every time the wind blew, and a mouth that
grinned from ear to ear when the big boys and girls
made the little ones run past it. The little ones
would steal up softly, and just when they were near
the fiery head the big ones would cry out, “Look
out, little uns, the goblin’ll get cher”; and the little
ones would dash past, laughing and shrieking.</p>

<p>So it was that the outside of the Pumpkin did
its part and played high jinks with the children.
Great fun it was; and it kept up until the farmer
called out, “Time for bed, boys and girls.”</p>

<p>Just as he said this the wind put the fire out of the
Pumpkin’s head and blew him off the hitching post.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
And the next thing he knew he was going down a
pig’s throat, the very piggy wig he met so long ago.</p>

<h3>A HORSE’S STORY</h3>

<p>Here is a story told by Black Beauty, as pretty
a little horse as ever wore a white star on his
forehead.</p>

<p class="tb">One day late in the autumn my master had a long
journey to go on business. I was put to the dog-cart,
and John, the coachman, drove. There had
been a great deal of rain, and now the wind was
very high and blew the dry leaves across the road
in a shower. We went along merrily till we came
to the toll-bar and the low wooden bridge. The
river banks were rather high, and the bridge, instead
of rising, went across just level, so that in
the middle, if the river was full, the water would
be nearly up to the woodwork and planks. But as
there were good, substantial rails on each side,
people did not mind it.</p>

<p>The man at the gate said the river was rising fast,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
and he feared it would be a bad night. Many of
the meadows were under water, and in one low part
of the road the water was halfway up to my knees.
The bottom was good, however, and master drove
gently, so it was no matter.</p>

<p>When we got to the town I had, of course, a good
feed, but as the master’s business engaged him a
long time, we did not start for home till rather late
in the afternoon. The wind was then much higher,
and I heard the master say to John we had never
been out in such a storm. And so I thought, as we
went along the skirts of a wood, where the great
branches were swaying about like twigs, and the
rushing sound was terrible.</p>

<p>“I wish we were well out of this wood,” said my
master.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said John, “it would be rather awkward
if one of these branches came down on us.”</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when
there was a groan, and a crack, and a splitting
sound. And crashing down amongst the older trees
came an oak, torn up by the roots. It fell across
the road just before us. I will never say I was not
frightened, for I was. I stopped still, and I believe
I trembled. Of course I did not turn round or run
away; I was not brought up to that. John jumped
out and in a moment was at my head.</p>

<p>“That came very near,” said my master.
“What’s to be done now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“Well, sir, we can’t drive over that tree, nor yet
get round it. There’s nothing for us but to go
back to the four cross-ways, and that will be a good
six miles before we get round to the wooden bridge
again. It will make us late, but the horse is fresh.”</p>

<p>So back we went and round by the cross roads.
By the time we got to the bridge it was very nearly
dark. We could just see that the water was over
the middle of it. As this sometimes happened when
there were floods, master did not stop. We were
going along at a good pace, but the moment my feet
touched the first part of the bridge, I felt sure there
was something wrong. I dared not go forward, and
I made a dead stop. “Go on, Beauty,” said my
master, and he gave me a touch with the whip, but
I dared not stir. He gave me a sharp cut. I jumped,
but I dared not go forward.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong, sir,” said John, and
he sprang out of the dog-cart, and came to my head
and looked all about. He tried to lead me forward.
“Come on, Beauty; what’s the matter?” Of
course, I could not tell him, but I knew very well
that the bridge was not safe.</p>

<p>Just then the man at the toll-gate on the other
side ran out of the house, tossing a torch about
violently.</p>

<p>“Hoy, hoy, hoy! halloo! stop!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” shouted my master.</p>

<p>“The bridge is broken in the middle, and part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
it is carried away; if you come on you’ll be into the
river.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” said my master. “You Beauty!”
said John, and took the bridle and gently turned me
round to the right-hand road by the river side. The
sun had set some time. The wind seemed to have
lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the
tree. It grew darker and darker, stiller and stiller.
I trotted quietly along, the wheels hardly making a
sound on the soft road. For a good while neither
master nor John spoke, and then master began in
a serious voice. I could not understand much of
what they said, but I found they thought that if I
had gone on as the master wanted me, horse, chaise,
master, and man would have fallen into the river.
Master said, God had given men reason, by which
they could find out things for themselves; but he
had given animals instinct, which did not depend on
reason, and which was much more prompt and perfect
in its way, and by which they had often saved
the lives of men.</p>

<p>At last we came to the park gates, and found the
gardener looking out for us. He said that mistress
had been much alarmed ever since dark, fearing
some accident had happened, and that she had sent
James off on Justice, the roan cob, towards the
wooden bridge to make inquiry after us.</p>

<p>We saw a light at the hall door and at the upper
windows, and as we came up, mistress ran out, saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
to master, “Are you really safe, my dear? Oh!
I have been so anxious, fancying all sorts of things.
Have you had no accident?”</p>

<p>“No, but if your Black Beauty had not been wiser
than we were, we should all have been carried down
the river at the wooden bridge.” I heard no more,
as they went into the house, and John took me to
the stable. Oh, what a good supper he gave me
that night, a good bran mash and some crushed
beans with my oats, and such a thick bed of straw!
and I was glad of it, for I was tired.</p>

<h3>A BEWITCHED DONKEY</h3>

<p>There was once a little donkey who lived with a
little old woman and her tabby cat and her rooster
and his hens and their chicks in a little cottage out
in the country. Every morning, after cropping the
dewy grass, the little donkey used to poke his head
in at the cottage window, as much as to say, “It’s
time we were off,” and the little old woman used to
say, “I’ll be with you in two shakes of Tabby’s
tail.” Presently out she would bring two baskets
of fresh-laid eggs from the hens and hang them
across the donkey’s back, and off to market they’d
go. Tabby would stop washing her face to wave
her paw at them, and the little old woman would
wave her hand back, and the little donkey would turn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
and wave his head. They were as happy and loving
as any people that ever lived together, and the
donkey was the man of the family.</p>

<p>But one morning something got into the donkey.
He seemed to be bewitched. You shall hear.</p>

<p>When he had cropped the dewy grass as usual, he
poked his head in at the cottage window, as much
as to say, “It’s time we were off,” and the little old
woman said, “I’ll be with you in two shakes of
Tabby’s tail.” But the minute she came to the door
with the two baskets of fresh-laid eggs from the
hens, up went the little donkey’s heels, and away he
ran with such a kick and a run and a run and a kick
that the little old woman couldn’t keep up with him
were she never so quick. All at once she was so surprised
at him that she stood stock still. Immediately
stock still stood the little donkey and laughed at her
till his fat little sides shook, “Hee haw, hee haw, hee
haw.” This was too much for the little old woman.
“Can it be that my own little donkey is laughing at
his little old woman?” she said. And one basket of
eggs dropped smash on the ground and she began to
cry.</p>

<p>At this out came Tabby, and up came running all
the hens and their little chicks and the lordly rooster,
and they all rubbed against the little old woman’s
skirts, and Tabby miowed, “Our little old woman,
do not cry,” and the hens cackled it, and the little
chicks peeped it, and the rooster crowed it. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
then they all said it together, each in his own
way.</p>

<p>“But the man of the family has run away from
us and he laughs at it,” said the little old woman;
“whatever shall we do!”</p>

<p>“Let us give him another chance,” said the big
white hen with the kind face. “Begin all over again
and see what happens.”</p>

<p>So the rooster led the way back to the yard, and
the hens followed him and the little chicks followed
them. At the same time Tabby led the way back
to the cottage and the little old woman followed
her. When the little old woman was inside she
began packing the one basket of eggs into the two
baskets. Well, sure enough, the little donkey did
his part, too. He ran back and began cropping the
dewy grass, and then he poked his head in at the
cottage window as much as to say, “It’s time we
were off,” and the little old woman in high glee
called out, “I’ll be with you in two shakes of
Tabby’s tail.”</p>

<p>But the minute she came to the door with the two
baskets of fresh-laid eggs from the hens, up went
the little donkey’s heels, and away he ran with such
a kick and a run and a run and a kick that the little
old woman couldn’t keep up with him were she
never so quick. And as before, all at once she was
so surprised at him that she stood stock still. Immediately
stock still stood the little donkey and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
laughed at her till his fat little sides shook, “Hee
haw, hee haw, hee haw.” And, as before, this was
too much for the little old woman. “Can it be that
my own little donkey is laughing at his little old
woman?” she said. And one basket of eggs
dropped smash on the ground and she began to cry.</p>

<p>At this out came Tabby, and up came running all
the hens and their little chicks and the lordly rooster,
and they all rubbed against the little old woman’s
skirts, and Tabby miowed, “Our little old woman,
do not cry,” and the hens cackled it, and the little
chicks peeped it, and the rooster crowed it. And
then they all said it together, each in his own way.</p>

<p>So it was of no use.</p>

<p>But at last the little old woman thought of a plan,
such an easy thing, too, and sure to be what a little
old woman would think of sooner or later to keep
the man of the family. Instead of staying in the
cottage, when they went back to try it over a third
time, she went out by a back door and crept around
the side of the house. When the donkey poked his
head in at the window she ran out, caught him by
the heels, shoved him in, jumped in after him, and
held him. The lordly rooster and the hen and the
little chicks were watching, and they ran in and shut
both doors fast. And then they all waited and listened,
and presently the donkey began to explain
himself.</p>

<p>The moonlight the night before was so strong,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
he said, that it woke him up. As he opened his eyes
he heard little voices, as sweet as silver bells, singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O lovely moon, queen of the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beautiful moon, glorious and bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Hail, all hail!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">He looked out of his shed into the moonlight, and
there on the green he saw the most exquisite fairies,
with wings shining with all the colors of the rainbow,
hand in hand with big-eyed tiny elves with
bumpy heads and little legs. They were all dancing
in a ring and looking up at the moon. And the
moon was gazing down at them.</p>

<p>Now he knew very well that the fairy folk do not
like to be spied on; he had often heard the little
old woman tell it to her gossip, Tabby, the cat.
And she had warned him to stay in his stall and not
go prying on the night folk. And he said he was
truly sorry now that he did it, but at the time he
thought it would be fun. So he stole up around a
stack of hay near where they were dancing in honor
of the moon, and all at once he gave such a bray
that the fairies fell to the ground in little swoons,
and the elves jumped so high into the air that for a
whole second he lost sight of them.</p>

<p>But the moonlight showed <em>them</em> where he was.
Quick as a wink they whipped little horns out of their
belts and blew together three times. Up came hobbling
from the shadows an old witch. She saw the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
donkey at once, and pointing her long finger at his
heels cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Kick him, heels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Until he feels</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ashamed to spy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At fairy reels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">He-he-he!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He must kick</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And run away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fill the air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With donkey bray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Until he eats</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A wisp of hay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Given by bat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or by cat.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well, Tabby was off to a stable before one shake
of her own tail, and presently back she came with
the wisp of hay. The little old woman gave it to
the little donkey and held her breath to see what
would happen, and so did Tabby and the lordly
rooster and the hens and the little chicks. No sooner
had the donkey swallowed it than he left off kicking
and trying to run away!</p>

<p>So now, of course, everything came right. The
lordly rooster led his wives and children back to the
henyard, and the little old woman and the little
donkey set off to market with the eggs that had not
been smashed. Tabby stopped washing her face to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
wave her paw at them, and the little old woman
waved her hand back, and the little donkey turned
and waved his head.</p>

<p>And ever after they were as loving and happy as
any people that ever lived together, and the donkey
was the man of the family.</p>

<h3>THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Tell with stick-figure blackboard illustrations.</i>)</p>

<p>In a village there lived an old woman who one day
gathered some beans from her garden to cook. She
had a good fire on the hearth, but, to make it burn
more quickly, she threw on a handful of straw. As
she threw the beans into the pot to boil, one of them
fell on the floor unseen by the old woman, not far
from a wisp of straw. Suddenly a glowing coal
bounced out of the fire, and fell close to them. They
both started away, and exclaimed, “Dear friend,
don’t come near me till you are cooler. Whatever
brings you out here?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied the coal, “the heat luckily made
me so strong that I was able to bounce from the
fire. Had I not done so, my death would have been
certain, and I should have been burnt to ashes by
this time.”</p>

<p>“I, too, have escaped with a whole skin,” said the
bean; “for had the old woman put me into the pot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
with my comrades, I should have been boiled to
broth.”</p>

<p>“I might have shared the same fate,” said the
straw, “for all my brothers were pushed into fire
and smoke by the old woman. She seized sixty
of us at once, and brought us in here to take
away our lives, but luckily I slipped through her
fingers.”</p>

<p>“Well, now what shall we do with ourselves?”
said the coal.</p>

<p>“I think,” answered the bean, “as we have been
so fortunate as to escape death together, we may as
well be companions, and travel away together to
some more friendly country.”</p>

<p>This pleased the two others; so they started on
their journey together. After traveling a little distance,
they came to a stream, over which there was
no bridge of any sort.</p>

<p>Then the straw thought of a plan, and said, “I
will lay myself across the stream, so that you may
step over me, as if I were a bridge.”</p>

<p>So the straw stretched himself from one shore
to the other, and the coal, who was rather hot-headed,
tripped out quite boldly on the newly built
bridge. But when he reached the middle of the
stream, and heard the water rushing under him, he
was so frightened that he stood still, and dared not
move a step farther. The straw began to burn,
broke in two, and fell into the brook. The coal slid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
after him, hissed as he reached the water, and gave
up the ghost.</p>

<p>The bean, who had cautiously remained behind
on the shore, could not keep in when she saw what
had happened, and laughed so heartily that she burst
her sides. It would have been all over with her, too;
but, as good luck would have it, a tailor, out on his
travels, came to rest by the brook, and noticed the
bean. He was a kind-hearted man, so he took a
needle and thread out of his pocket, and, taking up
the bean, sewed her together. She thanked him
prettily, but unfortunately he had only black thread
to sew with, and so since that time all beans have a
black seam down their sides.</p>

<h3>MOTHER HOLLE</h3>

<p>There was once a widow who had two daughters.
One of them was pretty and industrious, but the
other was ugly and idle. Now the mother was much
fonder of the ugly and idle one, because this was
her own daughter. She made the other do all the
work, and be the Cinderella of the house. Every
day the poor girl had to sit by a well, in the highway,
and spin and spin till her fingers bled.</p>

<p>One day as she worked the shuttle got marked
with her blood, so she dipped it into the well, to wash
the mark off. But it dropped out of her hand and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
fell to the bottom. She began to weep, and ran to
her mother and told her of the mishap. But the
mother scolded her sharply, and was so cruel as to
say, “As you have let the shuttle fall in, you must
fetch it out again.”</p>

<p>The girl went back to the well, and did not know
what to do. In the sorrow of her heart she jumped
into the well, and lost her senses from fright.</p>

<p>When she awoke and came to herself again, she
was in a beautiful meadow where the sun was shining
and many thousands of flowers were growing.
Along this meadow she went, and came to a baker’s
oven full of bread, and the bread cried out,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, take me out!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take me out!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or I shall burn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have baked a long time!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So she went up to it, and took out all the loaves,
one after another, with the bread-shovel. After that
she went on till she came to a tree covered with
apples, which called out to her,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, shake me!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shake me!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We apples are all ripe!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So she shook the tree till the apples fell like rain,
and went on shaking till they were all down, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
when she had gathered them into a heap, she went
on her way.</p>

<p>At last she came to a little house out of which
peeped an old woman. The old woman had such
large teeth that the girl was frightened, and was
about to run away.</p>

<p>But the old woman said, “What are you afraid
of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do all
the work in the house properly, you shall be the
better for it. Only you must take care to make my
bed well, and to shake it thoroughly till the feathers
fly—for then there is snow on the earth. I am
Mother Holle.”</p>

<p>The old woman spoke so kindly to her, the girl
took courage and agreed to enter her service. She
did everything so well that she pleased her mistress,
and always shook her bed so vigorously that the
feathers flew about like snowflakes. She had a
pleasant life with the old woman, never an angry
word, and boiled or roast meat every day.</p>

<p>But after she had stayed some time with Mother
Holle, she became sad. At first she did not know
what was the matter with her, but at last she felt
it was homesickness. Although she was many thousand
times better off here than at home, still she had
a longing to be there. So one day she said to the
old woman, “I wish I were home, no matter how
well off I am down here, I cannot stay any longer;
I must go up again to my own people.” Mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
Holle said, “I am glad that you long for your
home, and as you have served me so truly, I myself
will take you up again.” She took her by the hand,
and led her to a large door. The door opened, and
just as the maiden was standing beneath the door-way,
a heavy shower of golden rain fell, and all the
gold remained on her, so that she was covered
with it.</p>

<p>“You shall have that because you are so industrious,”
said Mother Holle; and at the same time
she gave her back the shuttle which the girl had let
fall into the well. Then the door closed, and the
maiden found herself up above the earth, not far
from her mother’s house.</p>

<p>As she went into the yard, the cock standing by
the well-side cried,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“Cock-a-doodle-doo!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your golden girl’s come back to you!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So she went in to her mother. And because she
arrived covered with gold, her mother and sister
were glad to have her back.</p>

<p>The girl told all that had happened to her. As
soon as the mother heard how she had come by so
much gold, she was very anxious that the same good
luck should come to the ugly and lazy daughter.
So she made <em>her</em> seat herself by the well and spin.
But the idle girl did not work. To stain the spindle
with blood, she stuck her hand into a thorn bush and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
pricked her finger. Then she threw the shuttle into
the well, and jumped in after it.</p>

<p>She came, like the other, to the beautiful meadow
and walked along the very same path. When she
came to the oven, the bread again cried,</p>

<p>Neither did she make Mother Holle’s bed as she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
ought, and did not shake it so as to make the feathers
fly up. Mother Holle was soon tired of this, and
gave her notice to leave. The lazy girl was willing
enough to go, and thought that now the golden rain
would come. Mother Holle led her, too, to the great
door; but while she was standing beneath it, instead
of the gold a big kettle of black pitch was emptied
over her. “That is the reward of your service,”
said Mother Holle, and shut the door.</p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Arranged as a continued story</i>)</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">How He Came to His Mother and Father</span></h4>

<p>Long, long ago, when good King Arthur ruled in
Britain, there lived a magician named Merlin. He
could change himself into anything he chose, and
one day when he had changed himself into a beggar
he stopped at a plowman’s cottage to ask for food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“Come in, poor fellow,” cried the plowman,
“there’s always a bite for another.” And the
plowman’s wife set on the table a bowl of milk
and a platter heaped with sweet brown bread. Merlin
was greatly pleased with the good people’s kindness
to him.</p>

<p>Now, by and by he noticed that although everything
in the cottage was neat and comfortable, something
was troubling these kind people. So he asked
them what it was.</p>

<p>“Ah,” cried the poor woman, with tears in her
eyes, “we have no little son. If I only had a little
son, I should be the happiest woman in the world,
even if he were no bigger than my husband’s thumb.”</p>

<p>Well, Merlin said nothing, and when he had rested
he went on his way.</p>

<p>But he did not forget the kind people’s sorrow.
As soon as he could, he paid a visit to the queen of
the fairies, and told her about it and begged her to
grant the woman’s wish. Sure enough, after a time
the plowman’s wife had a little son, and lo and
behold! he was not a bit bigger than her husband’s
thumb. While his mother was admiring him, the
queen of the fairies came in at the window. She
kissed the child and called him Tom Thumb. She
sent for some of the fairies to dress him, and she
herself told what he should wear.</p>

<p>So the fairies came and dressed the little man
according to the queen’s directions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“An oak leaf hat he had for a crown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His shirt of web by spiders spun;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With jacket wove of thistle down;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His trousers were of feathers done.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His stockings, of apple-rind, they tie</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With eyelash from his mother’s eye;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His shoes were made of mouse’s skin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tann’d with the downy hair within.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So it was that Tom Thumb, the fairy mannikin,
came into the world; and, wonderful to tell, he
never grew any bigger than his father’s thumb.</p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How He Grows up Full of Tricks</span></h4>

<p>But as he got older he grew to be full of tricks.</p>

<p>He used to play cherry-stones with the boys.
When he had lost all his own stones, he would creep
slyly into his playmates’ bags, quickly fill his pockets
with their stones, creep out unseen, and join again
in the game.</p>

<p>One day as he did this the boy who owned the bag
caught him at it. “Ah, ha! my little Tommy,” he
cried, “at last I have caught you stealing my cherry-stones.
I’ll teach you to stop that.” And he quickly
drew the string, shutting Tom into the bag, and gave
the bag such a shake that the poor little fellow’s legs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
and thighs and body were sadly bruised. Tom
roared with pain and promised never to do that
again.</p>

<p>So he was cured of that trick.</p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How He Has a Narrow Escape from a Batter Pudding</span></h4>

<p>A short time afterwards Tom’s mother was making
a batter pudding for supper, and inquisitive little
Tom must of course see how it was made. So he
climbed up to the edge of the bowl; but unfortunately
his foot slipped and in he plumped, head and
ears, into the batter. His mother, poor woman,
never caught sight nor light of him, so she stirred
him into the batter and put it into the pot to boil.</p>

<p>Now, the batter had filled Tom’s mouth and kept
him from crying out to his mother. But when he
felt the water getting hot, he kicked and struggled
so much in the pot that his mother thought the pudding
must be bewitched. She pulled it out of the
pot and threw it outdoors. A poor tinker crying,
“Pots to mend, kettles to mend,” was passing in the
nick of time, so, thinking it would make him a good
dinner, he stuffed it into his pack and walked
off with it. By this time Tom’s mouth was clear of
the batter, so he yelled lustily to be let out. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
terrified tinker flung down his pack and ran away.
The pudding broke to pieces, and Tom crept out,
covered with batter, but glad to be alive and to make
his way home as fast as he could.</p>

<p>When Tom’s mother saw the state of her darling
she was ready to weep. She put him into a teacup
of warm water and washed off the mess. Then, forgetting
the loss of her pudding, she kissed him and
tucked him into bed.</p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How He Gets into the Red Cow’s Stomach</span></h4>

<p>Well, soon after the batter pudding mischief, Tom’s
mother went to milk her cow in the meadow, and
she took Tom along with her. As the wind was
strong she was afraid he might be blown away, so
she took out of her pocket a piece of fine thread and
tied him to a thistle. Then she set about milking the
cow.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before the cow caught sight of
Tom’s oak leaf hat, and thrusting out her tongue she
took in poor Tom and the thistle at a mouthful.
Tom was terrified. But while the cow was chewing
the thistle he had time to collect his wits, although he
was afraid every minute her monstrous teeth would
crush him in pieces. So he roared out as loudly as
he could, “Mother, mother!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>“Where are you, Tommy, my darling? where are
you?” cried his mother, dropping her milking.</p>

<p>“Here, mother,” he shouted, “here, in the red
cow’s mouth.”</p>

<p>At this his poor mother began to cry and wring
her hands, looking helplessly at the cow. But what
was her joy! The cow, surprised at the odd noise
in her throat, opened her mouth and let Tom drop
out. Quick as a flash his mother caught him up before
he could fall to the ground, and she ran home
with him.</p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How He Comes to Belong to the King</span></h4>

<p>One day when Tom went into the fields to drive the
cattle with a whip of barley straw his father had
given him, he slipped and rolled into one of the furrows.
A raven flying overhead picked him up and
flew with him to the top of a giant’s castle near the
sea, and there left him.</p>

<p>Tom did not know what to do. But this was not
the worst of it. He heard a heavy tread, tramp!
tramp! and out strode Grumbo, the giant who owned
the castle. He saw Tom, picked him up and gulped
him down in a twinkling, as if he were a pill. But
in a minute he was sorry. For Tom began to kick
and jump about so that the giant could not stand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
him in his stomach, but rushed to the castle wall
and vomited him into the sea.</p>

<p>Well, the instant Tom struck the water a great
fish swallowed him. Soon a fisherman caught this
very fish, took it to market, and there sold it for
King Arthur’s own table. And when the king’s
cook cut the fish open, out stepped Tom, alive and
well, and stood on his head for joy to find himself
safe and free again. The astonished cook ran with
him to the king, and Tom so delighted the king and
queen and all the knights of the Round Table with
his tricks that the king called him his dwarf, to make
fun for him and the court.</p>

<p>In time the king grew so fond of Tom that he
took him everywhere with him, and even let him
creep into his pocket for shelter if it should rain
when they were out together.</p>

<p>So now Tom Thumb was King Arthur’s dwarf
and lived at court.</p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How He Carries Money to His Parents</span></h4>

<p>One day King Arthur asked Tom about his parents,
whether they were as small as Tom, and whether
they were rich or poor. Tom told the king his
father and mother were as tall as any of the people
at court but they were poor. At this the king took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
Tom into the treasury and told him to take home
to his parents as much money as he could carry.</p>

<p>Tom capered for joy. He ran off to get a purse,
and into this he stuffed a silver threepenny piece.
He had some trouble hoisting the bag of money on
his back, but at last he succeeded, and set out on his
journey.</p>

<p>It was a short distance, but tiny Tom had to rest
more than a hundred times by the way, so that it
took him two days and two nights to reach his
father’s house. His mother ran out to meet him,
and carried him into the house more dead than alive.</p>

<p>She and the father were overjoyed to see him,
the more so as he had brought such a great sum
of money; but they were grieved that he was so
worn out. His mother placed him tenderly in a
walnut shell, and feasted him three whole days on
a hazel nut. To her sorrow this made him sick, for
he should not have eaten a whole nut in less than
a month.</p>

<p>In time, Tom was able to run about and to
think of returning to court. But as there had
been a heavy fall of rain his mother said the roads
were too wet for him to walk. So when the wind
was blowing in the direction of the king’s castle
she made a little umbrella of paper, tied Tom to it,
gave him a puff into the air with her mouth, and
away he went back to King Arthur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How He Becomes Ill and Who Nurses Him</span></h4>

<p>Well, Tom was never tired making fun for the
king and queen and all the court. The courtiers
laughed till their sides ached at his antics, and the
king said to the queen, “Did you ever see the like?”
And she said, “No, never!”</p>

<p>But he did so much, he at last made himself ill.
The whole court was filled with sorrow, for everyone
feared the little fellow would die. The king
came constantly to his bedside to ask how he was,
and brought his cleverest physicians to cure him.
But they could not.</p>

<p>In the midst of their anxiety the queen of the
fairies ordered her chariot drawn by winged butterflies,
and set out for the palace. She lifted Tom
tenderly out of his bed and carried him with her
to fairyland. Here she herself nursed him back
to health and let him play with the fairies until he
was as strong and merry as ever.</p>

<p>Then she ordered a breeze to rise. And on this
she placed Tom and sent him back to the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How Tom Escapes Hanging</span></h4>

<p>Now, just as Tom came flying back to King Arthur’s
court, the cook happened to be passing with the
king’s great bowl of frumenty, a dish the king was
very fond of. Unfortunately the little fellow fell
plump into the middle of it, splashing the hot frumenty
in the cook’s face. The cook, in a rage at
Tom for frightening and scalding him, ran to tell
the king that Tom had jumped into his Majesty’s
favorite dish out of idle mischief.</p>

<p>The king’s anger was terrible. He ordered Tom
to be seized and tried. No one dared plead for him,
so the king commanded that his head be cut off. A
crowd followed the headsman to see it done. The
headsman lifted his ax. Poor little Tom fell
a-trembling and looked about for some means of
escape. In the crowd he saw a miller with his mouth
open, like the booby he was. At a bound Tom leaped
into the miller’s mouth. He sprang in so nimbly
that no one, not even the miller himself, saw where
he went. So, as the headsman could not find Tom
to take off Tom’s head, he, like a sensible man,
shouldered his ax and went home; and the miller
went back to his mill.</p>

<p>When Tom heard the miller at work in the mill,
he knew he was far away from the court and entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
safe, so he immediately set about getting out.
He began to roll and tumble about in such an alarming
way that the miller took to bed and sent for
a doctor. When the doctor arrived, Tom began to
dance and sing, and the doctor, as much frightened
as the miller, sent in hot haste for five more doctors
and twenty learned men.</p>

<p>While the six doctors and the twenty learned men
were putting their wise heads together, the miller
happened to yawn. Seizing the chance, Tom took
another jump, but out of the miller’s mouth this
time, and alighted safe on his feet in the middle of
a table near the bed. Well, when the miller saw
the little bit of a creature that had tormented him,
it was his turn to fall into a rage at Tom. He laid
hands on him, opened the window, and threw him
into the river.</p>

<p>And a second time Tom was swallowed by a fish!
A large salmon swimming along snapped him up.
A fisherman caught the salmon and sold it in the
market for a great lord’s table. But when the lord
saw it he thought it such a fine fish that he made a
present of it to King Arthur. So when the cook
cut open the fish he found poor Tom and ran to the
king with him to make sure that he should not
escape again. But the king was busy and ordered
Tom to be kept locked up until he should send for
him.</p>

<p>The cook was determined that Tom should not get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
away, so he put him into a mouse trap closely wired.
When Tom had spent a week in the trap peeping
through the wires, the king sent for him. But to the
cook’s disappointment and Tom’s great delight, his
anger had gone. He forgave Tom for falling into
the frumenty, and made him again his dwarf, to
make fun for him and the court.</p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How He is Knighted by the King</span></h4>

<p>To reward Tom for his services to the court, the
king made him a knight. He told Tom to kneel
down. Then he struck him with his sword and
said, “With this sword I dub thee knight. Arise,
Sir Thomas Thumb.”</p>

<p>As Tom’s clothes had suffered in the batter pudding,
the frumenty, and the insides of the giant, the
miller, and the fishes, the king ordered that the new
knight should be given a handsome suit of clothes
and a horse and sword. How proud Tom was and
how splendid he looked! You shall hear about his
dress and his horse and sword:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of butterfly’s wings his shirt was made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His boots of chicken’s hide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by a nimble fairy blade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Well learned in the tailoring trade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His clothing was supplied.—</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">A needle dangled by his side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A dapper mouse he used to ride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus strutted Tom in lordly pride.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was great fun to see Tom mounted on the
mouse, as he rode out a-hunting with the king and
the other knights. They were all ready to die with
laughter as they looked at him and his prancing
charger.</p>

<p>But they were glad to call him a brother knight,
he was so brave.</p>

<p>One day as they were riding past a farmhouse a
large cat lurking about a door made a spring at
Tom and the mouse, seized them, and ran up a tree
with them. Here she began to devour the mouse.
Tom boldly drew his sword and stuck it into the
cat so fiercely that she was at last forced to drop
them. As they fell, one of the knights held out his
hat and caught them. He carried Tom home and
laid him on a bed of down in a little ivory cabinet
until he should get over the attack.</p>

<p>Tom was soon himself again, and dearer than
ever to the king and court.</p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">How He Goes Away and Comes Back Again</span></h4>

<p>Soon after, the queen of the fairies came to pay
Tom a visit, and when she left she took Tom back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
with her to fairyland. There he stayed several
years.</p>

<p>While he was gone King Arthur and the queen
and all the knights who knew Tom died, so when
he came back he found a new king reigning, King
Thunstone. All the courtiers flocked about the mannikin,
and asked him who he was, and whence he
came, and where he lived. Tom answered,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">“My name is Tom Thumb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">From the fairies I’ve come.</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">When King Arthur shone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">This court was my home.</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">In me he delighted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">By him I was knighted;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have you never heard of Sir Thomas Thumb?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The king was so charmed with this speech that he
at once made Tom court dwarf. He ordered his
builders to build Tom a gold palace a span high,
with a door an inch wide, and he ordered his coachmen
to give Tom a coach drawn by six small mice.
And so that he might sit upon the king’s table close
to his elbow, he ordered his cabinet makers to make
Tom a little ivory chair.</p>

<p>So there was Tom back at court again and king’s
favorite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<h3>TOM THUMB</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">What Became of Him at Last</span></h4>

<p>But Tom did not live much longer. A large spider
one day attacked him. Tom drew his sword and
fought well, but at last the spider’s poisonous breath
overcame him.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He fell dead on the ground where he stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the spider suck’d up every drop of his blood.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Well, of course he had to die some time.</p>

<p>King Thunstone and his whole court were so sorry
that they went into mourning for him, and over his
grave they raised a white marble monument. And
the king’s engraver wrote this on it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Here lyes Tom Thumb, King Arthur’s knight,</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<h3>THE TWO BROTHERS</h3>

<p>Once upon a time there were two brothers. Each
had ten loaves of bread and nothing else. So they
said, “Let us go and seek our fortune.” And they
went.</p>

<p>When they had gone a little way they were hungry.
One brother said to the other, “Come, let us
eat thy bread first, then we shall eat mine.” So
they did and went on their way. When they had
gone farther they were hungry again. The first
brother said again to the other, “Come, let us eat
thy bread, then we shall eat mine.” They did and
went on their way. And when they had gone farther
they finished the ten loaves. Then the first
brother, who had yet kept <em>his</em> loaves, said to the
other, “Now thou mayst go thy way, and I shall
go mine. Thou hast no loaves left, and I will not
let thee eat my bread.” And the heartless fellow
turned his back and left his brother to go on alone
without a morsel of food.</p>

<p>Well, the brother went on and on and on, more
and more feebly, for want of food, till he came
to a mill in a dark forest. He said to the miller,
“I can go no farther; pray let me stay here
to-night.”</p>

<p>Now the miller was a truer brother to him than
his own had been, and he answered, “Brother, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
would not turn thee away if it were safe. But wild
beasts come into this wood at night, perhaps into
this very mill. I myself do not wait to see.”</p>

<p>“I feel no fear,” said the poor boy; “the beasts
will not harm me.” So while the miller went off
home he crept into the hopper of the mill.</p>

<p>At midnight from some place or other a big bear,
a wolf, and a jackal came into the mill, and went
leaping and bounding about as if they were having
a dance. When they had done the bear said,
“Come, let us each tell something he has seen or
heard. I’ll begin.</p>

<p>“I know a hill where there is a great heap of
money. It glitters when the sun shines. If anyone
should go there on a sunny day, he would find his
fortune.”</p>

<p>“I know a town,” said the wolf, “where there is
no water. Every mouthful has to be brought from
a great distance. Now, in the center of that very
town, hidden under a stone, where no one can see
it, is beautiful pure water. Whoever finds the stone
will make a fortune.”</p>

<p>“What I can tell is best of all,” said the jackal.
“I know of a king who has only one daughter, and
she lies weak and pale now three long years. If
only someone would bathe her in beech leaves she
would grow strong and rosy. Whoever cures her
will make his fortune.”</p>

<p>At the last word day began to dawn. The bear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
the wolf, and the jackal left the mill and disappeared
into the wood.</p>

<p>The boy had heard it all. Full of thanks he came
out of the hopper. “Perhaps,” said he to himself,
“I may be the one to find the money, take away the
stone, and cure the king’s daughter. If so, my fortune
is sure.”</p>

<p>He set forward with a stout heart just as the sun
rose. Soon its beams fell on a hill to the right and
something glittered in its rays. And here he found
the great heap of money, a fortune in itself. Farther
on he came to the town where the people had no
water. In the center of it there was the stone. He
rolled it away, and behold! streams of clear water
gushed forth. The people ran to get pitchers and
filled them to overflowing. And they gave him a
great sum of gold and silver. After this he set out
for the kingdom of which the jackal had spoken.
When he arrived he asked the king, “What wilt
thou give me if I cure thy daughter?”</p>

<p>“If thou canst do this,” said the king, “thy fortune
is made, for I will give thee my daughter as thy
wife.”</p>

<p>The youth gathered the beech leaves, the princess
bathed in them, and was cured. In great joy the
king married the maiden to the youth. So now his
fortune was made.</p>

<p>The news of this reached the ears of the selfish
brother. He came to his brother and asked how it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
had all happened. When he heard he said, “I also
will go and stay at that mill a night or two.” His
brother warned him of the danger. But he would
not listen. He reached the mill, crept into the hopper,
and waited.</p>

<p>As before, at midnight, from some place or other,
the bear, the wolf, and the jackal came into the mill,
and went leaping and bounding about as if they
were having a dance. And when they had done the
bear said, “Come, let us each tell something he has
seen or heard. I’ll begin.</p>

<p>“Next day after I told you my story the money
was all taken away.”</p>

<p>The wolf said, “And the stone was rolled away
and the water found.”</p>

<p>“And the king’s daughter was cured,” added the
jackal.</p>

<p>“Then perhaps someone was listening when we
talked here,” growled the bear.</p>

<p>“Perhaps someone is here now,” howled the wolf
and the jackal.</p>

<p>“Let us go and look,” shrieked the three.</p>

<p>They looked up and down and round about and in
all the corners. At last they poked their noses into
the hopper. And that was the end of the greedy
brother.</p>

<p>But he who had married the king’s daughter lived
happy ever after and when the king died ruled well
and wisely.</p>

<h3>THE WOOING</h3>

<h3>JACK-THE-GIANT-KILLER</h3>

<p>When good King Arthur ruled the land, there lived
near Land’s End in England, in a place called Cornwall,
a farmer who had an only son named Jack.
Jack was wide awake and ready of wit, so that
nobody and nothing could worst him.</p>

<p>In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept
by a huge giant named Cormoran. He was so fierce
and frightful to look at that he was the terror of all
the neighboring towns and villages. He lived in a
cave in the side of the mount, and whenever he
wanted food he waded over to the mainland and took
whatever came in his way. At his coming everybody
ran away, and then of course he seized the
cattle, making nothing of carrying off half-a-dozen
oxen on his back at a time, and as for sheep and
hogs he tied them around his waist as if they were
tallow dips. He had done this for many years, and
all Cornwall was in despair.</p>

<p>One day Jack happened to be in the town-hall
when the magistrates were sitting in council to
think what was best to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“What reward,” he asked, “will be given to the
man who kills Cormoran?”</p>

<p>“He may take the treasure the giant has stored
in his cave,” they said.</p>

<p>Quoth Jack, “Let me have a try at it.”</p>

<p>So he got a horn and shovel and pickaxe. And in
the dark of a winter’s evening he went over to the
mount and fell to work. Before morning he had dug
a pit twenty-two feet deep and nearly as broad, and
covered it with sticks and straw. Then he strewed
a little earth over it so that it looked like plain
ground. He then placed himself on the farther side
of the pit, and just at the break of day put his horn
to his mouth and blew, Tan-tiv-y, Tan-tiv-y!</p>

<p>The noise roused the giant. He rushed out of his
cave, crying, “You villain, have you come here to
disturb my rest? You shall pay dearly for this. I
will take you whole and broil you for breakfast.”
He had no sooner said this than he tumbled into the
pit and made the very foundations of the mount
shake.</p>

<p>“Oh, Giant,” quoth Jack, “where are you? Has
the earth swallowed you up? What do you think
now of broiling me for breakfast? Will no other
food do than sweet Jack?” Then he gave a most
mighty knock with his pickaxe on the very crown
of the giant’s big head, and killed him on the spot.</p>

<p>Jack then filled up the pit with earth, and went to
the cave and took the treasure. When the magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
heard of Jack’s success, they made a law and
wrote it on their books that henceforth he should be
called</p>

<p class="center">Jack-the-Giant-Killer,</p>

<p class="noindent">and they presented him with a sword and belt, and
on the belt they wrote these words,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Here’s the right valiant Cornish man</div>

<h3>THE PIXIES’ THANKS</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, and a long time ago, and a long,
long time before that, a little old woman had a garden.
And in this garden she planted a beautiful bed
of tulips. The slim green stalks of them stood in
the earth, tall and straight. And every other row of
lovely cups they held was red and every other was
yellow. At twilight the little old woman patted
down the last of them, and went in to boil the kettle
for her tea.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as she was gone there came peeping
and tripping from the field near by a crowd of pixies.
They ran between the rows, and skipped from one
flower to the next, and put their slender fingers
down into the cups, and clapped their fairy palms
together and cried, “How lovely!” But the little
old woman drinking her tea before the fire didn’t
hear a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>Well, night came, and the pixies’ teeny weeny
bits of elfin babies grew sleepy. They must have
bawled, though of course big ears like yours and
mine couldn’t have heard them, for all of a sudden
all the little pixies scampered home, crying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Coming,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My teeny one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Coming,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My weeny one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Watch glowworm</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My speck of delight!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then the cleverest little pixie mother among
them thought of something. “Let’s lay them in
those lovely cradles,” said she; “they’ll be as safe
as a bug in a rose while we are greeting the queen.”
She at once picked up her baby and ran back with
it to the garden. And so did the others with theirs.
They laid the tiny babies in the tulip cups and sang
them to rest. The tulips rocked to and fro in the
wind and made music for the lullaby. The little
old woman washing her teacup caught a note of the
music and singing, and stopped her clatter to listen,
it was so sweet.</p>

<p>As soon as the elfin babies were fast asleep, the
pixies tripped lightly off on the very tiptop tips of
their toes. The silver Moon was rising, and they
were just in time to form a ring on the green and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
dance in her honor. They circled nine times and
then looked up at her, and she beamed down on
them and they bowed low. Then she passed on
through the heavens to make way for the day.</p>

<p>It was now the dawn of morning. The pixies
ran back to the tulip cradles in the little old woman’s
garden, crying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Weeny</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sleepy head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Leave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dewy bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To get up</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soft tulip</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Cup.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little old woman awoke in the nick of time
to hear them kissing and caressing the elfin babies
as they carried them home. In a bound she was
out of bed and at the window, but they had vanished.</p>

<p>For all that she knew they had been there. She
could tell it by the tulips. The slim green stalks of
them stood in the earth, as they had when she
planted them, tall and straight. And every other
row of lovely cups they held was red and every
other was yellow. Yet there was a wonderful
change. It wasn’t only the shining drops of dew
on them. No, it was something more wonderful—it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
was fairy fragrance. Every tulip smelled as
sweet as a rose. This was the pixies’ thanks to the
little old woman.</p>

<p>News of these rare tulips went far and wide, and
people came from here, there, and everywhere to
buy them. So for the rest of her days the little old
woman had plenty of money for many a cup of tea,
and a pinch of snuff into the bargain.</p>

<h3>THE CAT AND THE PARROT</h3>

<p>Once there was a cat and once there was a parrot.
They agreed to invite each other to dinner, turn
and turn about. The cat should ask the parrot to-day,
and the parrot should ask the cat to-morrow.</p>

<p>Well, it was the cat’s turn first. The cat went to
market and bought nothing but a pennyworth of
rice. The parrot could make no dinner on this
meager fare. And what is more, the cat was so ill-mannered
that he actually made the parrot cook the
food himself. Of course the parrot was too well-bred
to complain.</p>

<p>Next day came the parrot’s turn. He went to
market and bought a leg of meat and a whole fish,
head and tail and all, and about thirty pounds of
flour, and a tub of butter, and great bunches of luscious
grapes. And before his guest came he cooked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
the food. He made heaps and heaps of brown,
crisp spice cakes, thick with currants, oh, enough to
fill a washerwoman’s basket.</p>

<p>Well, the cat came, and the parrot set the whole
meal before him, keeping only two cakes for himself.
The cat ate the meat till he licked the plate,
and he picked the fish till the bones were clean, and
he sucked the grapes till the skins were dry, and
then he began on the cakes; and he ate the whole
basketful. Then he looked up at the parrot and
said, “Have you any more?”</p>

<p>“Take my two cakes,” said the parrot. And the
cat took them. Then he looked up at the parrot
and said, “Have you any more?”</p>

<p>This was too much for the parrot. Bristling his
feathers, he said sharply, “There’s nothing left but
me.” And the cat looked him over, licked his chops,
and—gullup, gulloo—down went the parrot,
bones, beak, and feathers.</p>

<p>Now an old woman had seen it all, and she was
so shocked she picked up a stone, and cried, “You
unnatural cat, how could you eat your friend the
parrot? Scat! away with you, before I hit you with
this stone.”</p>

<p>“Old woman,” said the cat, “I’ve eaten a basketful
of cakes, I’ve eaten my friend the parrot, and
shall I blush to eat an old hag like you? No, surely
not.” And—gullup, gulloo—down went the old
woman with the stone in her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>Then the cat walked along the road till he met a
man beating a donkey to make him go. “Cat,”
cried the man, “get out of the way, or my donkey
may kick you.”</p>

<p>“Man,” said the cat, “I’ve eaten a basketful of
cakes, I’ve eaten my friend the parrot, I’ve eaten
an old woman, and shall I blush to eat a miserable
donkey driver? No, surely not.” And—gullup,
gulloo—down went the man and his donkey.</p>

<p>After this the cat walked on again till he met a
wedding procession. At the head came the king
with his newly made bride, and behind him marched
a company of soldiers, and behind them tramped ever
and ever so many elephants, two and two, and two
and two, and two and two, and a great many
more.</p>

<p>“Cat,” said the happy king, kindly, “turn out of
the road a little, or my elephants may trample you
to death.”</p>

<p>“King,” said the cat, “you don’t know me. I’ve
eaten a basketful of cakes, I’ve eaten my friend the
parrot, I’ve eaten a miserable man and his donkey,
and shall I blush to eat a beggarly king? No, surely
not.” And—gullup, gulloo—down went the king,
down went the queen, down went the soldiers, bayonets
and all, down went the elephants, two and two
and two and two.</p>

<p>After this the cat walked on more slowly, for he
was somewhat heavy. On the way two landcrabs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
went scuttling across the road. “Run away, run
away, Pussycat,” they squeaked, “or we might
nip you.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed the cat, shaking his fat
sides. “Ho, ho, ho!” he roared, showing his teeth;
“you don’t know me. I’ve eaten a basketful of
cakes, I’ve eaten my friend the parrot, I’ve eaten a
miserable man and his donkey, I’ve eaten a king
and his bride, I’ve eaten a company of soldiers,
I’ve eaten a herd of elephants, two and two, and
shall I blush to eat two silly little landcrabs? Nay,
not so.” And he pounced upon the landcrabs,
gullup, gulloo, gulloo, gullup, in two swallows they
were inside the cat.</p>

<p>But—when their eyes were used to the darkness,
the landcrabs made out the king sitting with his
head in his hands, very unhappy. Across his knee
lay the newly made bride in a dead faint. Near
them the company of soldiers were trying to form
fours. Behind these the elephants were trumpeting,
the donkey was braying, the parrot was whetting his
beak on his own claws, and the old woman was
scolding the cat roundly. In a corner they made out
a great pile of cakes.</p>

<p>The landcrabs said, “His sides are soft: let’s
get out.” Nip, nip, they went, nip, nip, nip. And
out they scuttled. Then out walked the king with
his bride on his arm, out marched the soldiers, out
tramped the elephants, two and two, out went the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
man and his donkey without any beating, out hobbled
the old woman, and out flew the parrot.</p>

<p>And the cat had to spend a night and a day sewing
up his sides.</p>

<h3>LAMPBLACK</h3>

<p>A poor black paint lay very unhappy in its tube.
It had tumbled out of an artist’s color-box and had
lain unnoticed for a year. “I am only Lampblack,”
he said to himself. “The master never looks at me:
he says I am heavy, dull, lusterless, useless. I wish
I could cake and dry up and die, as poor Flakewhite
did.”</p>

<p>But Lampblack could not die; he could only lie in
his tin tube and pine, like a silly, sorrowful thing as
he was, in company with some broken bits of charcoal
and a rusty palette-knife. The master never
touched him; month after month passed by, and he
was never thought of; the other paints had all their
turn of fair fortune, and went out into the world to
great halls and mighty palaces, transfigured and
rejoicing in a thousand beautiful shapes and services.
But Lampblack was always passed over
as dull and coarse. Indeed he knew himself to be
so, poor fellow, and this made it all the worse.
“You are only a deposit!” said the other colors to
him; and he felt that it was disgraceful to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
deposit, though he was not quite sure what it
meant.</p>

<p>“If only I were happy like the others!” thought
poor, sooty Lampblack, sorrowful in his corner.
“There is Bistre, now, he is not so very much
better-looking than I am, and yet they can do nothing
without him, whether it is a girl’s face or a
wimple in a river!”</p>

<p>The others were all so happy in this beautiful
bright studio, where the open casements were hung
with green myrtle, and where the silence was filled
with the singing of nightingales. Cobalt, with a
touch or two, became the loveliness of summer skies
at morning; the Lakes and Carmines bloomed in a
thousand exquisite flowers and fancies; the Chromes
and Ochres (mere dull earths) were allowed to
spread themselves in sheets of gold that took the
shine of the sun into the darkest places; Umber, a
somber and gloomy thing, could lurk in a child’s
curls and laugh in a child’s smiles; whilst all the
families of the Vermilions, the Blues, the Greens,
lived in a perpetual glory of sunset or sunrise, of
ocean waves or autumn woods, of kingly pageant
or of martial pomp.</p>

<p>It was very hard. Poor Lampblack felt as if his
very heart would break, above all when he thought
of pretty little Rose Madder, whom he loved dearly,
and who never would even look at him, she was so
proud, because she was always placed in nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
less than rosy clouds, or the hearts of roses, or
something as fair and spiritual.</p>

<p>“I am only a wretched deposit!” sighed Lampblack,
and the rusty palette-knife grumbled back,
“My own life has been ruined in cleaning dirty
brushes!”</p>

<p>“But at least you were of use once; but I never
am,—never!” said Lampblack. And indeed he
had been there so long that the spiders had spun
their silver fleeces all about him, and he was growing
as gray as an old bottle does in a dark cellar.</p>

<p>At that moment the door of the studio opened,
and there came a flood of light, and the step of a
man was heard; the hearts of all the colors jumped
for joy. It was their magician, who out of mere
common clays and ground ores could raise them at
a touch into splendors immortal.</p>

<p>Only the heart of poor dusty Lampblack did not
beat a throb the more, because he was always left
alone and never was thought worthy of even a glance.
But he could not believe his senses when the master
crossed the floor to the dark corner where he lay
under the spiders’ webs. Lampblack felt sick and
faint with rapture. Had his turn come at last?</p>

<p>The master took him up. “You will do for this
work,” he said; and Lampblack was borne trembling
to an easel. The colors, for once neglected,
crowded together to watch, looking in their bright
tin tubes like rows of little soldiers in armor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>“It is dull Old Deposit,” they murmured to one
another, and felt contemptuous, but curious, as
scornful people often will be.</p>

<p>“I am going to be glorious and great,” thought
Lampblack, and his heart swelled high; for nevermore
would they be able to hurl the name of Deposit
at him, a name which hurt all the more because he
did not know what it meant.</p>

<p>“You will do for this work,” said the master,
and let Lampblack out of his metal prison-house
into the light and touched him with the brush that
was the wand of magic.</p>

<p>“What am I going to be?” wondered Lampblack,
as he felt himself taken on to a large piece of
deal board, so large that he felt he must be going to
make at the least the outline of an athlete or the
shadows of a tempest.</p>

<p>He could not tell what he was becoming; but he
was happy enough and grand enough only to be used.
He began to dream a thousand things of all the
scenes he would be in, and all the hues that he
would wear, and all the praise that he would hear
when he went out into that wonderful world where
his master was so much admired.</p>

<p>But he was harshly roused from his secret dreams;
all the colors were laughing and tittering round him
till the little tin helmets they wore shook with their
merriment.</p>

<p>“Old Deposit is going to be a sign-post,” they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
cried to one another so merrily that the spiders, who
are not companionable creatures, came to the doors
of their dens to chuckle too. A sign-post! Lampblack,
stretched out in joy upon the board, roused
himself and gazed at the change. He had been
made into seven letters, thus:</p>

<p class="center">BANDITA.</p>

<p class="noindent">This word in the Italian country, where the English
painter’s studio was, means, Do not trespass, Do not
shoot, Do not show yourself here: anything, indeed,
that is uncivil to all comers. In these seven
letters, outspread upon the board, was Lampblack
disgraced!</p>

<p>Farewell, hopes and dreams! He had been employed
to paint a sign-board, a thing stoned by the
boys, blown on by the winds, gnawed by the rats,
and drenched with the winter’s rains. Better the
dust and the cobwebs of his old corner than such
shame as this!</p>

<p>But there was no help for it. He was dried with
a drench of turpentine, hastily clothed in a coat of
copal, and, ere he yet was fully aware of all his
misery, was being borne away upon the great board
out of doors and handed to the gardener. It was
the master himself who did this to him. As the
door closed on him, he heard all the colors laughing,
and the laugh of little Rose Madder was highest
of all as she cried to Naples Yellow, who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
a dandy and made court to her, “Poor old ugly Deposit!
He will grumble to the owls and the bats
now!”</p>

<p>The door shut him out forever from all the joyous
company and the palace of beauty, and the
rough hands of the gardener grasped him and carried
him to the edge of the garden, where the wall
overlooked the public road, and there fastened him
up on high with a band of iron round the trunk
of a tree.</p>

<p>That night it rained heavily, the north wind blew,
and there was thunder. Lampblack, out in the storm
without his tin house to shelter him, felt that of all
creatures wretched on the face of the earth there
was not one so miserable as he. A sign-board!
Nothing but a sign-board!</p>

<p>A color, created for art and artists, could not feel
more grievously disgraced. Oh, how he longed for
his tin tube and the quiet nook with the charcoal and
the palette-knife! He had been unhappy there indeed,
but he had had some sort of hope to comfort
him,—some chance still remaining that one day
he might be allowed to be at least the shadow of
some immortal work. Now—nevermore could he
be anything but what he was; change there could
be none till weather and time should have done
their work on him, and he be rotting on the wet
earth, a shattered and worm-eaten wreck.</p>

<p>Day broke,—a gloomy, misty morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>From where he was disgraced upon the tree-trunk
he could no longer even see his beloved home, the
studio; he could see only a dusky, intricate tangle of
branches all about him, and below the wall of flint,
with the Banksia that grew on it, and the hard
muddy highway, drenched with the storm of the
night.</p>

<p>A man passed in a miller’s cart, and stood up and
scowled at him, because the people had liked to come
and shoot and trap the birds of the master’s wooded
gardens, and they knew that they must not do it now.
A slug crawled over him, and a snail also. A woodpecker
hammered at him with its strong beak. A
boy went by under the wall, and threw stones at him,
and called him names. The rain poured down again
heavily. He thought of the happy painting-room,
where it had seemed always summer and always
sunshine, and where now in the forenoon all the
colors were marshaling in the pageantry of the Arts,
as he had seen them do hundreds of times from his
lonely corner. All the misery of the past looked happiness
now.</p>

<p>“If I were only dead, like Flakewhite,” he
thought; but the stones only bruised, they did not
kill him; and the iron band only hurt, it did not
stifle him. For whatever suffers very much, has
much strength to continue to exist. His loyal heart
almost hated the master who had brought him to
such a fate as this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>The day grew apace, and noon went by, and with
it the rain passed. The sun shone out once more,
and Lampblack, even imprisoned and wretched as
he was, could not but see how beautiful the wet
leaves looked, and the gossamers all hung with rain-drops,
and the blue sky that shone through the
boughs; for he had not lived with an artist all his
days to be blind, even in pain, to the loveliness of
nature. Some little brown birds tripped out too with
the sun—very simple and plain in their dress, but
Lampblack knew they were the loves of the poets,
for he had heard the master call them so many times
in summer nights. The little brown birds came tripping
and pecking about on the grass underneath his
tree-trunk, and then flew on the top of the wall,
which was covered with Banksia and many other
creepers. The brown birds sang a little song, for
though they sing most in the moonlight they do sing
by day too, and sometimes all day long. And what
they sang was this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, how happy we are, how happy!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No nets dare now be spread for us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No cruel boys dare climb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And no cruel shooters fire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are safe, quite safe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sweet summer has begun!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lampblack listened, and even in his misery was
soothed by the tender liquid sounds that these little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
throats poured out among the bloom of the Banksia
flowers. And when one of the brown birds came
and sat on a branch by him, swaying itself and
drinking the rain-drops off a leaf, he ventured to
ask, as well as he could for the iron that strangled
him, why they were so safe, and what made them so
happy.</p>

<p>The bird looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“Do you not know?” he said. “It is you!”</p>

<p>“I!” echoed Lampblack, and could say no more,
for he feared that the bird was mocking him, a poor,
silly, rusty black paint, only spread out to rot in fair
weather and foul. What good could he do to any
creature?</p>

<p>“You,” repeated the nightingale. “Did you not
see that man under the wall? He had a gun; we
should have been dead but for you. We will come
and sing to you all night long, as you like it; and
when we go to bed at dawn, I will tell my cousins,
the thrushes and merles, to take our places, so that
you shall hear somebody singing near you all day
long.”</p>

<p>Lampblack was silent. His heart was too full to
speak. Was it possible that he was of use, after all.</p>

<p>“Can it be true?” he said, timidly.</p>

<p>“Quite true,” said the nightingale.</p>

<p>“Then the master knew best,” thought Lampblack.</p>

<p>The colors in the studio had all the glories of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
world, but he was of use in it, after all; he could
save these little lives. He was poor and despised,
bruised by stones and drenched by storms; yet was
he content, for he had not been made quite in vain.</p>

<p>The sunset poured its red and golden splendors
through the darkness of the boughs, and the birds
sang all together, shouting for joy and praising
God.</p>

<h3>LAZY JACK</h3>

<p>Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was
Jack. His mother was very poor, but she was hard-working
and tried to get her living by spinning.
Jack was so lazy he never did anything to help her.
So, at last, she said that he should not eat his
porridge unless he earned it.</p>

<p>At this out shuffled Jack and hired himself to a
farmer and got for his day’s labor a shining new
penny. Home he went with it, but on the way let
it slip out of his fingers into a brook, unknown to
himself.</p>

<p>When his mother saw him smiling and holding his
fist closed, she said, “Well, Jack, did you earn your
porridge to-day?”</p>

<p>“That I did, mother,” said Jack, “and here’s the
penny.” With that he opened his empty hand.</p>

<p>“A penny,” cried his mother, in high delight,
“give it here, my darling boy.” But when she saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the empty hand she changed her tune. “You stupid
lout,” said she, “you’ve lost the good money.
That’s no way to bring home a penny. The safest
thing to do with a penny is to put it into your pocket
and come straight home.”</p>

<p>“Say no more about it, sweet mother,” whimpered
Jack, “that’s what I’ll do the next time.” So
his mother gave him his supper.</p>

<p>The next day Jack went out again, and this time
hired himself to a cowherd and got for his day’s
labor a jug of new milk. Jack took the jug,
squeezed it into the largest pocket of his coat, and
set off home, spilling the milk at every step, so that
by the time he got home there wasn’t a drop left.</p>

<p>When his mother saw his pocket bulging out, she
asked, “What have you there, Jack, my son?”</p>

<p>“A jug of new milk, mother,” answered Jack,
tugging it out of his pocket.</p>

<p>“A jug of new milk,” cried his mother, “and
you’ve spilled it! Have you no sense, you ninny-hammer?
That’s no way to bring home a jug of
milk. The safest way to carry a jug of milk is to
put it on your head and hold it with both hands and
come straight home.”</p>

<p>“Say no more about it, sweet mother,” whimpered
Jack, beginning to blubber; “that’s what I’ll do
the next time.” So his mother gave him his supper
that time, too.</p>

<p>Well, the next day Jack hired himself to a farmer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
and got for his day’s labor a fine fresh cream cheese.
Jack took that cheese, placed it on his head, held it
down firmly with both hands, and set out home.
Now, Jack’s head was warm and the cheese was soft.
So it wasn’t long before it began to get softer. By
the time he reached home part of it had oozed down
over his face and more of it had matted into his
hair; he was a sight to behold.</p>

<p>When his mother saw him, she threw up her arms
and cried, “Dearie me, dearie me, whatever has
happened to my own bonny son?”</p>

<p>“Why, nothing, mother,” said Jack, “and see the
fine cheese I’ve brought you home.” With that he
took down from his head a bit of grease in each
hand.</p>

<p>“You’ve spoiled a cheese, a fine cream cheese,”
screamed his mother. “Have you no sense at all,
at all, in your empty head, you numbskull? That’s
no way to bring home a cheese. The safest thing
to do with a cheese is to take it in both hands, hold
it out before you, and come straight home.”</p>

<p>“Say no more about it, sweet mother,” said Jack,
beginning to snuffle, “that’s what I’ll do the next
time.”</p>

<p>So he didn’t go supperless to bed that night either.</p>

<p>It was a baker Jack hired himself to the next day,
and at the close of it the baker gave him a cat.
“Your mother will find her a good mouser,” said
he. And Jack said, “Thank you, kindly, sir,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
took the cat. He held her with both hands out before
him and started straight for home. On the
way a mouse scurried across his path and the cat
leaped from his hands; but Jack still held them out,
ready for her when she should come back, and kept
on toward home.</p>

<p>When he reached home his mother looked at his
hands and said, “What have you in your hands,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“I had a cat, mother,” said he, “a good mouser,
but she made after a mouse and hasn’t come back
yet.”</p>

<p>“Get out of my sight,” cried his mother, “before
I lose my patience and do something I might be
sorry for. Haven’t you an atom of sense about
you at all, at all, at all? Wouldn’t a child know
that’s no way to bring home a live cat? The safest
thing to do with a cat is to tie a string around her
neck, put her on the ground, and draw her home
after you.”</p>

<p>“Say no more about it, sweet mother,” cried
Jack, bawling outright; “that’s what I’ll do the
very next time.” So his mother wouldn’t see him
starve that night.</p>

<p>Well, the very next day Jack hired out to a
butcher, and got for his day’s labor a splendid shoulder
of mutton for Sunday’s dinner, for this was
Saturday. Jack took the mutton, tied a string
around it, put it on the ground, and dragged it home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
after him in the mud and dirt. So by the time he
got home the meat was completely ruined.</p>

<p>When his mother saw it she was so upset that she
threw her apron over her head and rocked herself
to and fro and wept aloud. “If you had the least
grain of sense in you, you useless omadhaun,” she
wailed, “you’d have brought the sweet meat home
on your shoulder.”</p>

<p>Jack put his arms around his mother and kissed
her and promised to do that the next time. So she
gave him his supper, but they had to make their
Sunday dinner of cabbage.</p>

<p>Monday morning, bright and early, Jack went
out once more and hired himself to a cattle-drover
and for his day’s labor got a donkey. Although
Jack was a husky fellow, he found it hard to hoist
the donkey on his shoulder, but mindful of his
mother’s grief he got it up and set out home slowly
with the prize.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that on the way home he had to
pass the house of a beautiful girl who unfortunately
was deaf and dumb. The doctors said she
would never speak until someone should make her
laugh. Many had tried but without success. In
despair her father, who was very rich, had promised
that very day whoever could make her laugh should
marry her.</p>

<p>The girl happened to be looking out of the window
when Jack came along with the donkey on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
shoulders, its legs sticking up in the air. He looked
so funny she burst into a merry fit of laughter, and
at once was able to hear and speak.</p>

<p>So her father, overjoyed, gave her to Jack with
a sackful of money and more to come.</p>

<p>“My love, your fortune is made,” cried his
mother, when she heard the good news. And she
went to live with Jack and his bride, and they all
had plenty and were happy ever after.</p>

<h3>THE TIME THAT WILL COME AGAIN</h3>

<p>One warm bright day in autumn, when the whole
world was changing to brown and red and gold,
a little squealing pig was sent by his mother to bring
home some beechnuts to Piggikin, the baby.</p>

<p>“They’re dropping now, tender and sweet, in
the wood,” said Mother Sow. “Off with you and
get some.” So</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With a run and a squeal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away went the pig,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With an odd little reel.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, on the way he passed a boy and a girl sitting
by the roadside, with their backs to him. And the
boy was saying to the girl,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">And fiddles danced the barn hops”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“That’s very strange,” said the pig; “can it be
true? I’ll ask the old witch owl about it. I’d like
a pair of wings; I’d fly high, I can tell you.” So</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and he left the path to the wood to make for a barn
half a mile off, where the old witch owl lived.</p>

<p>On the way he met a pup whose father had told
him to guard the kennel while he himself went in
search of a bone. The pup was rolling on the
ground in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“O roly-poly pup,” called out the pig, “what do
you think I heard this morning?”</p>

<p>“What?” said the roly-poly pup, running away
from the kennel.</p>

heels to get rid of the pack on his back. And they
called out to him, “O kicking, kicking donkey, what
do you think we heard this very morning?”</p>

<p>“What?” said the kicking, kicking donkey, as he
kicked the pack from his back.</p>

<p>“That’s very strange,” said the donkey; “can

</div>

<p>Halfway to the barn they met a fiddle lying near
a bench. He was in such a bad temper that he had
broken the string that makes the sweetest music.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
But the others were too full of their news to notice
his ill humor.</p>

<p>“O fiddle diddle,” they cried, “what do you think
we heard this very morning?”</p>

<p>“What?” snapped the fiddle, and he broke another
string.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What nonsense!” growled the fiddle, in such
an ugly tone that even the donkey rose on his hind
legs to cover his big ears with his forefeet.</p>

<p>“We’re going to ask the old witch owl about it,”
said the pup. “Come along and hear what she says.”</p>

<p>“Rr-r-r-r-zing, you silly thing,” snarled the fiddle,
so fiercely that without waiting for more,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With a run and a squeal</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And the ill-tempered fiddle followed after.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He sneaked along, though, behind the others, and
tripped often in his broken strings, and this made
his temper worse.</p>

<p>Well, the day was darkening into twilight when
they reached the barn. But they were so anxious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
to hear the old witch owl’s opinion that they didn’t
notice this. The old witch owl stood in a little round
opening in the front of the barn, high up near the
pointed top where the weathercock turns. She was
looking out into the gathering darkness, planning
her voyage into the night.</p>

<p>“There she is,” squealed the pig in a whisper,
getting behind the pup.</p>

<p>“Her ears are bigger than mine,” said the donkey,
getting behind the pig.</p>

<p>But the fiddle pushed to the front and growled,
“Rr-r-r-r-zing, you silly thing, I’m not afraid of
an old witch owl. I’ll ask the ridiculous question.”</p>

<p>“Do, sweet fiddle,” whispered the little squealing
pig and the roly-poly pup and the kicking, kicking
donkey, “how kind of you to have come.”</p>

<p>“Rr-r-r-r-zing, you silly thing, and you, and you;
I came to please myself.”</p>

<p>“Madame Witch Owl,” he growled, spoiling the
music of the verse, “is it true that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A long time ago pigs had wings</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And fiddles danced the barn hops?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The old witch looked down at him. And her eyes
glowed so much like two round wheels of fire that
the fiddle in secret fright burst another string. But
for all that he stared back at her. “Hoot-hoot-hoot,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
she cried, “wait till I’ve heard your betters.
Let the pig stand forth and the pup and the donkey.”</p>

<p>Out came the little squealing pig, but not very
far, so that the roly-poly pup might catch him by the
tail in case of need; and out came the roly-poly pup,
but not very far, so that the little squealing pig might
catch him by the tail in case of need; and out came
the kicking, kicking donkey, but not very far, so that
he might get behind the pup and the pig in case of
need.</p>

<p>“Pig, pig,” said the old witch owl, “how did you
hear this?”</p>

<p>And the little pig began in a squealing little voice
to tell her how Mother Sow had sent him to the
wood to get some beechnuts for Piggikin, the baby,
and how he had heard the boy tell it to the girl, and
how he had set off to ask her about it.</p>

<p>“And Piggikin is still hungry for the beechnuts,
is he?” asked the old witch owl, looking beyond the
little pig into the darkness.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the little pig, in a very little voice.</p>

<p>“And Mother Sow is getting anxious as the night
grows darker.”</p>

<p>“The night,” cried the little squealing pig and
the roly-poly pup and the kicking, kicking donkey,
drawing nearer together. And they looked fearfully
over their shoulders as the shadows of the
apple-tree near the barn moved nearer to them.</p>

<p>When the old witch owl brought back her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
from the darkness, she looked at the roly-poly pup,
and he went on to tell, in a very loud voice to give
himself courage, how his father had left him to
guard the kennel, but how when he heard the news
he, too, set off to ask her about it.</p>

<p>“And the kennel is still unguarded, is it?” asked
the old witch owl, looking beyond the roly-poly pup
into the darkness.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the roly-poly pup, in a very small
voice.</p>

<p>“And Father Dog is getting anxious as the night
grows darker.”</p>

<p>“The night,” cried the roly-poly pup and the
kicking, kicking donkey and the little squealing pig,
drawing nearer together. And they looked fearfully
over their shoulders as the shadows of the apple-tree
near the barn moved nearer to them.</p>

<p>When the old witch owl brought her eyes back
from the darkness she looked at the kicking, kicking
donkey, and he straightway began to roar how his
master had given him a pack to carry, but how,
when he heard the news, he had kicked it off and
set out to ask her about it.</p>

<p>When he finished he joined forepaws with the pig
and the pup and danced around the fiddle; the pig
singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O for a pair of wings to fly high,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the pup singing,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O to grow in a tree-top and see farther than my nose,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the donkey singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O to bray in rhyme and bring down the house.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And then they all sang together,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O for the time when pigs had wings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pups grew in the tree-tops,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In that good time donkeys brayed in rhyme,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fiddles danced the barn hops.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The fiddle never even noticed them; he still
stared at the old witch owl, though he did not dare
to say anything.</p>

<p>“You kicked off the pack, did you?” asked the
old witch owl, turning the full blaze of her eyes on
the donkey.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he gasped, running behind the pup and
the pig, and the pig tried to catch the pup by the tail,
and the pup tried to catch the pig by the tail.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” she cried in a frightful voice,
and her feathers stood out straight around her,
“that runaways and idlers will ever fly high or see
farther than their noses or bring music into the
world? They bring nothing but sorrow, sorrow to
those that love them.” And suddenly the old witch
owl looked out into the night and called,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“Hoo-oo-oo-oo. Is it you-oo-oo? Is it you-oo-oo?”</p>

<p>Immediately out of the night walked the mother
of the squealing pig and the father of the roly-poly
pup and the master of the kicking, kicking donkey.
And into the sky came the moon. And into the
moonlight trooped crowds of boys and girls from
the land of dreams, led by the boy and girl the little
pig had passed in the morning, more and more of
them, till they surrounded the barn and covered the
shadows cast by the apple-tree.</p>

<p>The little squealing pig ran to his mother and
the roly-poly pup ran to his father and the kicking,
kicking donkey ran to his master; and there was
great rejoicing. The donkey begged his master
for a beating, saying he richly deserved it, and so
did the pup and the pig. But the grown-ups said,
“They’ll do better next time.”</p>

<p>When the dream children heard this they streamed
out into the moonlight back to their dreams, singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The time will come again when pigs will have wings</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And fiddles will dance the barn hops.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And lo and behold! when the fiddle heard them
he felt his ill-humor slipping away. And as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
old witch owl looked at them his strings mended
themselves.</p>

<p>Dancing down the path and out into the moonlight
after the children he sounded his sweetest notes
in time to their singing; and the little pig and his
mother and the roly-poly pup and his father and the
donkey and his master followed and took up the
children’s song. To the very end of it the fiddle
danced and played his merriest. At the turn of the
road he looked back at the old witch owl and she was
looking at him.</p>

</div>

<p>And as she sailed off into the night he was sure

<h3>THE OWL’S ANSWER TO TOMMY</h3>

<p>One evening Tommy’s grandmother had been telling
him and his little brother Johnny a story about
a brownie who used to do all the work in a neighbor’s
house before the family got up in the morning.
But the maids caught sight of him one night, and
they felt so sorry to see his ragged coat that the next
night they laid near his bowl of bread and milk a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
new suit and a new linen shirt. Brownie put the
things on and danced around the room, singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What have we here? Hemten hamten!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here will I nevermore tread nor stampen.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And away he danced through the door and never
came back again. Tommy wanted to know why, but
his grandmother couldn’t tell him. “The Old Owl
knows,” she said, “I don’t. Ask her.”</p>

<p>Now Tommy was a lazy boy. He thought that if
only he could find a brownie that would do his work
he would save himself a great deal of trouble. So
that night, while little Johnnie lay sound asleep beside
him, in the loft of the kitchen, as rosy and
rosier than an apple, he lay broad awake, thinking
of his grandmother’s story. “There’s an owl living
in the old shed by the lake,” he thought. “It
may be the Old Owl herself, and she knows, Granny
says. When father’s gone to bed and the moon
rises, I’ll go and ask her.”</p>

<p>By and by the moon rose like gold and went up
into the heavens like silver, flooding the fields with
a pale ghostly light. Tom crept softly down the
ladder and stole out. It was a glorious night, though
everything but the wind and Tommy seemed asleep.
The stones, the walls, the gleaming lanes, were so
intensely still, the church tower in the valley seemed
awake and watching, but silent; the houses in the
village round it had all their eyes shut; and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
seemed to Tommy as if the very fields had drawn
white sheets over them, and lay sleeping also.</p>

<p>“Hoot! hoot!” said a voice from the fir wood
behind him. Somebody else was awake, then.
“It’s the Old Owl,” said Tommy; and there she
came swinging heavily across the moor with a flapping
stately flight, and sailed into the shed by the
lake. The old lady moved faster than she appeared
to do, and though Tommy ran hard she was in the
shed some time before him. When he got in, no
bird was to be seen, but he heard a sound from
above, and there sat the Old Owl, blinking at him—Tommy—with
yellow eyes.</p>

<p>“Come up, come up!” said she hoarsely. She
could speak then! Beyond all doubt it was <em>the</em>
Old Owl, and none other.</p>

<p>“Come up here! come up here!” said the Old
Owl.</p>

<p>Tommy had often climbed up for fun to the
beam that ran across the shed where the Old Owl
sat. He climbed up now, and sat face to face with
her, and thought her eyes looked as if they were
made of flame.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you want?” said the Owl.</p>

<p>“Please,” said Tommy, “can you tell me where
to find the brownies, and how to get one to come
and live with us?”</p>

<p>“Oohoo!” said the Owl, “that’s it, is it? I
know of two brownies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“Hurrah!” said Tommy. “Where do they
live?”</p>

<p>“In your house,” said the Owl.</p>

<p>Tommy was aghast.</p>

<p>“In our house!” he exclaimed. “Whereabouts?
Let me rummage them out. Why do they do
nothing?”</p>

<p>“One of them is too young,” said the Owl.</p>

<p>“But why doesn’t the other work?” asked
Tommy.</p>

<p>“He is idle, he is idle,” said the Owl, and she
gave herself such a shake as she said it that the
fluff went flying through the shed, and Tommy
nearly tumbled off the beam in fright.</p>

<p>“Then we don’t want him,” said he. “What is
the use of having brownies if they do nothing to
help us? But perhaps if you would tell me where
to find them,” said Tommy, “I could tell them what
to do.”</p>

<p>“Could you?” said the Owl. “Oohoo! oohoo!”
and Tommy couldn’t tell whether she were hooting
or laughing.</p>

<p>“Of course I could,” he said. “They might be
up and sweep the house, and light the fire, and spread
the tables, and that sort of thing, before Father
came down. The Brownie did all that in Granny’s
mother’s young days. And they might tidy the
room, and fetch the turf, and pick up my chips, and
sort Granny’s scraps. Oh! there’s plenty to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“So there is,” said the Owl. “Oohoo! Well,
I can tell you where to find one of the brownies;
and if you can find him, he will tell you where his
brother is. But all this depends upon whether you
feel equal to undertaking it, and whether you will
follow my directions.”</p>

<p>“I am quite ready to go,” said Tommy, “and I
will do as you tell me. I feel sure I could persuade
them to come; if they only knew how every one
would love them if they made themselves useful!”</p>

<p>“Oohoo! oohoo!” said the Owl. “Now listen.
You must go to the north side of the lake when the
moon is shining—(“I know brownies like water,”
muttered Tommy)—and turn yourself round three
times, saying this charm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Twist me, and turn me, and show me the Elf—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I looked in the water, and saw—’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When you have got so far look into the water, and
think of a word that will rhyme with Elf, and at the
same moment you will see the brownie.”</p>

<p>“Is the brownie a merman,” said Tommy, “that
he lives under water?”</p>

<p>“That depends on whether he has a fish’s
tail,” said the Owl, “and that you can see for
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well, the moon is shining, so I shall go,” said
Tommy. “Gooby-by, and thank you, Ma’am;” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
he jumped down and went, saying to himself, “I
believe he is a merman, all the same, or else how
could he live in the lake?”</p>

<p>The moon shone very brightly on the center of
the lake. Tommy knew the place well, for there
was an Echo there, with whom he had often talked.
Round the edges grew rushes and water plants,
and turning himself three times, as the Old Owl
had told him, he repeated the charm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Twist me and turn me and show me the Elf—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I looked in the water and saw—”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Now for it! He looked in, and saw—his own
face.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s no one there but myself!” said
Tommy. “And what can the word be? I must
have done it wrong. It cannot be myself.”</p>

<p>“Myself!” said the Echo.</p>

<p>Tommy was almost surprised to find the Echo
awake at this time of night.</p>

<p>“Much you know about it!” said he. “Belf!
Celf! Delf! Felf! Helf! Jelf! There can’t be
a word to fit it. And then to look for a brownie and
see nothing but myself!”</p>

<p>“Myself,” said the Echo.</p>

<p>“Will you be quiet?” said Tommy. “If you
would tell me the word there would be some meaning
in your interference; but to roar ‘Myself!’ at
me, which neither rhymes nor runs—it does rhyme,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
though, as it happens,” he added; “how very odd!
it runs too—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Twist me and turn me and show me the Elf—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I looked in the water and saw myself,’—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">which I certainly did. What can it mean? The Old
Owl knows, as Granny would say; so I shall go back
and ask her.”</p>

<p>And back he went. There sat the Old Owl as
before.</p>

<p>“Oohoo!” said she, as Tommy climbed up.
“What did you see in the lake?”</p>

<p>“I saw nothing but myself,” said Tommy, indignantly.</p>

<p>“And what did you expect to see?” asked the
Owl.</p>

<p>“I expected to see a brownie,” said Tommy;
“you told me.”</p>

<p>“And what are brownies like, pray?” inquired the
Owl.</p>

<p>“The one Granny knew was a useful little fellow,
something like a man,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the Owl, “but you know at present
this one is an idle little fellow, something like a little
man. Oohoo! oohoo! Good night, or rather, good
morning, for it is long past midnight.” And the old
lady began to shake her feathers for a start. “Stay,”
said she, “I think I had better take you home.”</p>

<p>“I know the way, thank you,” said Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>“Do as I say,” said the Owl. “Lean your full
weight against me and shut your eyes.”</p>

<p>Tommy laid his head against the Owl’s feathers.
Down he sank and sank. He jumped up with a start
to save himself, opened his eyes, and found that he
was sitting in the loft with Johnnie sleeping by his
side.</p>

<p>“Get up, Johnnie, I’ve a story to tell you,”
he cried. And he told Johnnie all about it.</p>

<p>And after that Tommy and Johnnie were the
most useful little brownies in that whole country.</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF COQUERICO</h3>

<p>Hear the story of this one.</p>

<p>He was a queer-looking little creature. He came
out in the brood of a handsome black Spanish hen.
All his brothers and sisters were as pretty as you
would see in a day’s walk, but he was very odd-looking.
He had only one good eye, one good wing,
and one good leg to carry him about, hippety-hop,
hippety-hop. When his mother saw he was crippled,
she at once loved him best, and gave him the splendid
name of Coquerico. But hear about him.</p>

<p>Maybe you think a one-eyed, one-armed, one-legged
chick like Coquerico would be good and
gentle. Why, if one of his brothers ran against him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
without meaning to, Coquerico flew at the poor
fellow and called him names. And he was so conceited
that he thought himself better than his
brothers and sisters, and that he knew more than his
mother.</p>

<p>So one day he hippety-hopped up to his mother
and said, “My lady mother, I am too good for this
family; I should be in the king’s court. I’m off
to Madrid, where the king lives.”</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of, my poor little one?”
cried his mother. “Who has put such nonsense
into your head? Where would my little crippled
one find a home like this—mulberry trees to shade
him, a white-washed henroost, a high dunghill,
worms and corn in plenty, brothers and sisters that
are fond of him, and a mother who loves him dearly.
Stay where you are, my child; believe me I know
what is best for you.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” said Coquerico, saucily. “I
don’t. I wish to go out into the world, where everyone
may hear of me, I am so clever. I’m off to
Madrid to see the king.”</p>

<p>“But, my son, have you never looked in the
brook?” asked his mother. “Don’t you know that
you have only one eye, one wing, and one leg? To
make your way in the world you need the sharp eyes
of a fox, the swift wings of a hawk, and the many
soft legs of a spider. Once outside, you are lost.”</p>

<p>“My good mother,” said Coquerico, just as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
saucily, “I am well able to take care of myself. I
am better than my family and must find people who
can see how clever I am. So I’m off to Madrid to
see the king.”</p>

<p>“Well, my son,” said the anxious mother-hen,
“listen to your mother’s last words. Keep away
from people known as cooks and scullions; you will
know them by their paper caps, tucked up sleeves,
and great sharp knives.”</p>

<p>So away went Coquerico, making believe not to
see the tear in his mother’s eye. Without caring
for those he left, he hippety-hopped out the gate
and stopped only long enough to crow three times,
“Cock-a-doodle-doo!” Then over the fields he
went hippety-hop, hippety-hop.</p>

<p>By and by he came to a small brook almost choked
by a couple of dead leaves. “My friend,” it called
out to him, “will you free me that I may flow on?
One stroke of your beak is enough.”</p>

<p>“Do I look like a brook-sweeper?” answered
Coquerico. “Help yourself; I’m off to Madrid to
see the king.” And on he went, hippety-hop, hippety-hop.</p>

<p>A little farther on Coquerico saw the wind lying
breathless on the ground. “Dear friend, help me,”
it cried; “here on earth we should help one another.
If you will fan me a little with your wing I shall have
strength to rise to my place among the clouds, where
I am needed for the next whirlwind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>“Do I look like a wind-bellows,” answered Coquerico;
“help yourself. I am off to Madrid to see
the king.” And on he went, hippety-hop, hippety-hop.</p>

<p>A little farther on he came to a newly mown
field, where the farmers had piled up the weeds to
burn them. As he stopped his hippety-hop to search
among a smoking heap for a kernel of corn, he saw
a little flame, barely flickering, it was so nearly out.</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” cried the flame, faintly, “will
you bring me a few dry straws to rekindle me that
I may burn brightly?”</p>

<p>“Do I look like a servant?” cried Coquerico,
haughtily; “I’ll teach you to call out to a fowl that
has business with the king.” And he leaped
on the heap of dried weeds and trampled it
down till it smothered the flame! Then he flapped
his one wing and crowed three times, “Cock-a-doodle-doo,”
as if he had done something to be
proud of.</p>

<p>And so strutting and crowing, though he had to
go hippety-hop, he arrived at Madrid and the king’s
palace. Grand and beautiful as it was, he did not
stop to look at it, but made for the hen yard, stopping
every second step to crow, “Cock-a-doodle,”
to tell the king and all the world he was coming.</p>

<p>In the hen yard there was of course no king, but
a boy with a paper cap on his head and sleeves
tucked up and a great sharp knife in his hand. “A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
scullion, I suppose,” said Coquerico to himself, “but
he will not stop me; I have business with the king.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re an odd one,” cried the boy, coming
over to look at the new-comer. “Cook wants a
rare bird for the king’s dinner, you’re just in time.”
And he seized Coquerico and carried him into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Here the cook popped him into a pot of water
and left him, and with the boy went out of the
kitchen to attend to something else.</p>

<p>The water began to get warm and then hot.
“Oh, Madame Water,” cried Coquerico, becoming
all at once as meek as a dove, “good and gentle
water, best and purest in the world, do not scald
me, I beg of you.”</p>

<p>“Did you show any pity, selfish wretch?” answered
the Water, boiling with indignation. Coquerico
leaped out of the pot, knocking off the cover,
only to land on the fire.</p>

<p>“Oh, Fire, Fire, do not burn me,” he cried,
dancing around on his back; “oh, beautiful and
brilliant flame, brother of the sun, and cousin of the
shining diamond, do not roast me.”</p>

<p>“Did you have any pity, you selfish wretch?”
cried the Fire, blazing so fiercely with anger that the
chick in frightful pain leaped out of a window
near by.</p>

<p>But as he landed on the flagging the Wind caught
him and whirled him up. “Oh, Wind,” shrieked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
Coquerico, faintly, “oh, kindly Wind, oh, cooling
breeze, you make me so dizzy my head reels. Pray
let me down that I may rest.”</p>

<p>“Let you rest,” roared the Wind, “wait and I’ll
teach you, you selfish wretch.”</p>

<p>And with one blast it sent him up so high that
as he fell down he stuck on a steeple.</p>

<p>There, if you look, you may see him to this very
day, forced at last to help others in this world, a
weathervane.</p>

<h3>THE SCARECROW</h3>

<p>Once upon a time there was an old black crow, as
old as the hills. And once there was a scarecrow,
brand new to his business. The scarecrow was made
of a corn stalk wearing the farmer’s cast-off hat and
coat.</p>

<p>The very first day he took up his post in the cornfield,
the old black crow, flying over, laughed at his
disguise.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Caw, caw, caw,” she cried,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“I know you, poor old stalk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bloodless is your body,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You neither run nor walk.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The scarecrow kept his temper and said nothing,
and this looks as if he were clever. For the old crow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
had to take herself off without knowing what he was
thinking of.</p>

<p>Now the scarecrow <em>was</em> clever. He made friends
with Magic Darkness and Moving Wind. He had
made up his mind to frighten thieving crows away,
no matter how old and knowing they might be.
And that very evening when the old black crow, as
old as the hills, came flying toward the cornfield,
with her five black children after her, he whispered,
“Now, Magic Darkness and Moving Wind, help
me.”</p>

<p>And they did. Magic Darkness came down and
hid his headlessness, and Moving Wind bent his
body and pushed his arms together so that he looked
exactly as if he were the farmer stooping to load a
gun.</p>

<p>When the old black crow saw this, she whispered,
“Turn back, children, and don’t speak for your
lives;” and although she was as old as the hills,
she turned tail as fast as she could, with her five
black children after her. When she reached her
nest built of sticks in the fork of an apple-tree a
quarter of a mile away, she breathed more freely.</p>

<p>“Oh, my children,” she panted, “it was no cornstalk
scarecrow at all; it was the farmer himself,
alive and loading his gun for us.”</p>

<p>But when she awoke in the morning light, she felt
rather puzzled. “I’ve seen a good many scarecrows
in my time,” she said; “I should know a man from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
a shadow. I’ll go and have a look at him in broad
daylight.”</p>

<p>So as soon as breakfast was over and the crow
children had gone to school to hear how featherless
children make crow’s nests with their fingers, she
spread her wings for the cornfield where she had
seen the brand new scarecrow. There he stood as
plain a humbug as ever deceived the eyes of a blind
crow.</p>

<p>“I’m not old enough to be blind yet,” she said;
“you’re a dried-up cornstalk if ever there was one.
You’ll not frighten me this evening and send me and
my children scurrying home.” And she sang
mockingly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Caw, caw, caw,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I know you, poor old stalk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bloodless is your body,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You neither run nor walk.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the clever scarecrow kept his temper and answered
never a word. So again the old crow had to
take herself off no wiser about his thoughts.</p>

<p>Well, toward evening along came flying again the
old black crow, as old as the hills, with her five black
children after her. And again the scarecrow whispered,
“Now, Magic Darkness and Moving Wind,
help me.” And they did. Magic Darkness came
down and hid his headlessness, and Moving Wind
bent his body and pushed his arms together, then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
straightened him suddenly, like this, halfway, and
held his arms out in front, one hand beyond the
other, so, as if he were searching for the trigger of
a gun.</p>

<p>When the old crow saw him she cried, “Turn
back, children, at once,” turning herself so suddenly
that she bumped into the beak of the first little
crow behind her. It was not until she reached her
nest built of sticks in the fork of the apple-tree a
quarter of a mile away, and had rested a minute,
that she breathed freely.</p>

<p>“Oh, my children,” she said, “without doubt it
was no scarecrow; it was the farmer, alive, and
placing his finger on the trigger of his gun to
shoot us.”</p>

<p>But again when she awoke in the morning light
she felt puzzled. “It’s very strange,” she said.
“I’ve seen a good many scarecrows in my time. I
should know a man from a shadow. I’ll have another
look at him in the broad daylight.”</p>

<p>So, as soon as breakfast was over and the crow
children had gone to school to hear how featherless
grown-ups get crow’s feet on their faces, she spread
her wings for the cornfield. There stood the scarecrow
as plain a humbug as ever deceived the eyes of
a blind crow.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “unless blindness is catching
and the bats gave it to me, you’re a dried-up corn
stalk if ever there was one. If an old crow that was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
living before you were even thought of knows anything,
you’ll not frighten me this evening!” And
she sang mockingly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Caw, caw, caw,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I know you, poor old stalk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bloodless is your body,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You neither run nor walk.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the clever scarecrow kept his temper, and answered
never a word. So again the old crow had to
take herself off no wiser about his thoughts.</p>

<p>Well, all good things go in threes, as every child
who knows more than a crow can tell you. So the
third evening along came flying the old black crow,
as old as the hills, with her five black children after
her. And the third time he whispered, “Now,
Magic Darkness and Moving Wind, help me.”
And the third time they did. Magic Darkness came
down and hid his headlessness, and Moving Wind
bent him sharply down, lifted him halfway with his
arms held out, one hand beyond the other, like this;
then suddenly straightened him up with arms pointing
up at the crows.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot, dear farmer,” shrieked the old
crow. She hadn’t time to turn tail. “My children
and I will let your corn alone until you have
harvested it.”</p>

<p>Immediately Moving Wind dropped the scarecrow’s
armless sleeves and brought his hat back to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
its position on the top of the stalk. And away flew
the old crow, as old as the hills, with her five black
children after her. When she reached her nest built
of sticks in the fork of the apple-tree a quarter of a
mile away, and she had rested two minutes, she said,
“My children, keep away from that field until I
tell you the corn has been gathered in.”</p>

<p>When the corn was harvested, the old black crow
and her five black children went gleaning to pick up
the kernels that had dropped, and fat eating they
had. And the scarecrow let them enjoy their meal
in peace; his duty was done.</p>

<h3>OEYVIND AND MARIT</h3>

<p>There was once a boy named Oeyvind who lived in
a hut at the foot of a steep rocky hill. On the roof
of the hut walked a little goat. It was Oeyvind’s
own. Oeyvind kept it there so that it should not go
astray, and he carried up leaves and grass to it.</p>

<p>But one fine day the goat leaped down, and away
it went up the hill until it came where it never
had been before. When Oeyvind ran out of the
hut after dinner, he missed his little goat and at
once thought of the fox. He looked all about, calling,
“Killy-killy-killy-goat!”</p>

<p>“Bay-ay-ay,” said the goat, from the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
hill, as it cocked its head on one side and looked down.
And at the side of the goat kneeled a little girl.</p>

<p>“Is it yours, this goat?” she asked.</p>

<p>Oeyvind stared at her, with eyes and mouth wide
open, and asked, “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“I am Marit, mother’s little one, father’s fiddle,
grandfather’s elf, four years old in the autumn, two
days after the frost nights.”</p>

<p>“Are you, though?” he said, as soon as he could
get his breath.</p>

<p>“Is it yours, this goat?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p>“I should like it. You will not give it to me?”</p>

<p>“No, that I won’t.”</p>

<p>Marit lay down, kicking her legs and looking up
at him, and then she said, “Not if I give you a
butter cake for him?”</p>

<p>Oeyvind had eaten butter cake only once in his
life, when his grandfather came to visit; anything
like it he had never eaten before nor since. “Let
me see the butter cake first,” said he.</p>

<p>It didn’t take Marit long to pull out a large cake.
“Here it is,” she said, and threw it down to him.</p>

<p>“Ow, it went to pieces,” said the boy. He gathered
up every crumb, and he couldn’t help tasting a
very small one. That was so good he had to eat
another. Before he knew it he had eaten up the
whole cake.</p>

<p>“Now the goat is mine,” said the girl, and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
laughed and clapped her hands. The boy stopped
with the last bit in his mouth.</p>

<p>“Wait a little while?” he begged, for he loved
his little goat.</p>

<p>The small girl got up quickly. “No, the goat is
mine,” she said, and she threw her arms around its
neck. She loosened one of her garters and fastened
it round the goat’s neck and began pulling the goat
after her. The goat would not follow: it stretched
its neck down to see Oeyvind. “Bay-ay-ay,” it said.
But the girl took hold of its fleece with one hand and
pulled the string with the other, and said, sweetly,
“Come, little goat, you shall go into my room and
eat out of my apron.” And then she sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come, boy’s goat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, mother’s calf,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, mewing cat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In snow-white shoes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, yellow ducks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come out of your hiding-place;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come little chickens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who can hardly go;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, my doves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With soft feathers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See, the grass is wet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the sun does you good:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And early, early, is it in summer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But call for the autumn, and it will come.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>And away she went with the goat, calling on all
living things she loved to follow her.</p>

<p>The boy stood still as a stone. He had taken
care of the goat since the winter before, and he had
never thought he would lose it. But now it was
gone in a moment and he would never see it again.
He lay down and wept.</p>

<p>His mother came along and saw him crying.
“What are you crying about?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, the goat, the goat!”</p>

<p>“Yes, where is the goat?” asked the mother,
looking up at the roof.</p>

<p>“It will never come back,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Why, how could that happen!”</p>

<p>He could not tell her at once.</p>

<p>“Has the fox taken it?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no.”</p>

<p>“Are your wits gone,” said his mother; “what
has become of the goat?”</p>

<p>“Oh-h-h—I sold it for—for—a cake!”</p>

<p>As soon as he had said it he knew what it was to
sell the goat for a cake.</p>

<p>“What can the little goat think of you, to sell
him for a cake?” said his mother.</p>

<p>The boy was so sorry that he said to himself he
would never again do anything wrong. He would
never cut the thread on the spinning-wheel, he would
never let the goats out of the fold, he would never
go down to the sea alone. He fell asleep where he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
lay, and he dreamed that the little goat had gone to
heaven and that he sat alone on the roof and could
not go to it.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came something wet close up to
his ear. He started up. “Bay-ay-ay!” it said.
It was the little goat come back.</p>

<p>“What, have you come back?” he cried. He
jumped up, took it by the forelegs, and danced with
it as if it were a brother. He tickled it and pulled
its beard, and set off with it to the hut to tell his
mother the good news.</p>

<p>Just then he heard someone behind him; it was
the little girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, so it was you brought it back?” said he.</p>

<p>“Grandfather would not let me keep it,” said she;
“he is waiting near for me.”</p>

<p>A sharp voice called out, “Now!” It was her
grandfather’s, and she remembered what she was to
do. She put one of her muddy hands into Oeyvind’s
and said, “I beg your pardon for taking the little
goat.” Then she could keep in no longer; she threw
her arms around the goat’s neck and wept aloud.</p>

<p>“You may have the goat,” said Oeyvind.</p>

<p>“Make haste,” cried grandfather. So Marit had
to go, and Oeyvind had his little goat again.</p>

<h3>BLUNDER</h3>

<p>Blunder was going to the Wishing-Gate, to wish
for a pair of Shetland Ponies, and a little coach,
like Tom Thumb’s. And of course you may have
your wish, if you once get there. But the thing is,
to find it; for it is not, as you imagine, a great gate,
with a tall marble pillar on each side, and a sign
over the top, like this, WISHING-GATE,—but
just an old stile, made of three sticks. Put up two
fingers, cross them on the top with another finger,
and you have it exactly,—the way it looks, I mean,—a
worm-eaten stile, in a meadow; and as there
are plenty of old stiles in meadows, how are you
to know which is the one?</p>

<p>Blunder’s fairy godmother knew, but then she
could not tell him, for that was not according to
fairy rules and regulations. She could only direct
him to follow the road, and ask the way of the first
owl he met; and over and over she charged him,
for Blunder was a very careless little boy, and
seldom found anything, “Be sure you don’t miss
him,—be sure you don’t pass him by.” And so
far Blunder had come on very well, for the road
was straight; but at the turn it forked. Should
he go through the wood or turn to the right? There
was an owl nodding in a tall oak-tree, the first owl
Blunder had seen; but he was a little afraid to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
wake him up, for Blunder’s fairy godmother had
told him that this was a great philosopher, who sat
up all night to study the habits of frogs and mice,
and knew everything but what went on in the daylight,
under his nose; and he could think of nothing
better to say to this great philosopher than,
“Good Mr. Owl, will you please show me the way
to the Wishing-Gate?”</p>

<p>“Eh! what’s that?” cried the owl, starting out
of his nap. “Have you brought me a frog?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Blunder, “I did not know that you
would like one. Can you tell me the way to
Wishing-Gate?”</p>

<p>“Wishing-Gate! Wishing-Gate!” hooted the
owl, very angry. “Winks and naps! how dare you
disturb me for such a thing as that? Do you take
me for a mile-stone? Follow your nose, sir, follow
your nose!”—and, ruffling up his feathers, the
owl was asleep again in a moment.</p>

<p>But how could Blunder follow his nose? His
nose would turn to the right, or take him through
the woods, whichever way his legs went, and “what
was the use of asking the owl,” thought Blunder,
“if this was all?” While he hesitated, a chipmunk
came scurrying down the path, and, seeing Blunder,
stopped short with a little squeak.</p>

<p>“Good Mrs. Chipmunk,” said Blunder, “can
you tell me the way to the Wishing-Gate?”</p>

<p>“I can’t, indeed,” answered the chipmunk,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
politely. “What with getting in nuts, and the care
of a young family, I have so little time to visit anything!
But if you will follow the brook, you will
find an old water-sprite under a slanting stone, over
which the water pours all day with a noise like
wabble! wabble! who, I have no doubt, can tell you
all about it.”</p>

<p>So Blunder went on up the brook, and, seeing
nothing of the water-sprite, or the slanting-stone,
was just saying to himself, “I am sure I don’t know
where he is,—I can’t find it,” when he spied a frog
sitting on a wet stone.</p>

<p>“Mr. Frog,” asked Blunder, “can you tell me
the way to the Wishing-Gate?”</p>

<p>“I cannot,” said the frog. “I am very sorry,
but the fact is, I am an artist. Young as I am, my
voice is already remarked at our concerts, and I
devote myself so entirely to my profession of music
that I have no time for general information. But
in a pine-tree beyond, you will find an old crow,
who, I am quite sure, can show you the way, as he
is a traveler, and a bird of an inquiring turn of
mind.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where the pine is,—I am sure I
can never find him,” answered Blunder, discontentedly;
but still he went on up the brook, till, hot
and tired, and out of patience at seeing neither crow
nor pine, he sat down under a great tree to rest.
There he heard tiny voices squabbling. And looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
about him, Blunder spied a bee, quarreling
with a morning-glory elf, who was shutting up the
morning-glory in his face.</p>

<p>“Elf, do you know which is the way to the
Wishing-Gate?” asked Blunder.</p>

<p>“No,” said the elf, “I don’t know anything
about geography. I was always too delicate to
study. But if you will keep on in this path, you will
find a Dream-man, coming down from fairyland,
with his bags of dreams on his shoulder; and if
anybody can tell you about the Wishing-Gate, he
can.”</p>

<p>“But how can I find him?” asked Blunder, more
and more impatient.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I am sure,” answered the elf,
“unless you look for him.”</p>

<p>So there was no help for it but to go on; and
presently Blunder passed the Dream-man, asleep
under a witch-hazel, with his bags of good and bad
dreams laid over him to keep him from fluttering
away. But Blunder had a habit of not using his
eyes, for at home, when told to find anything, he
always said, “I don’t know where it is,” or, “I
can’t find it,” and then his mother or sister went
straight and found it for him. So he passed the
Dream-man without seeing him, and went on till he
stumbled on Jack-o’-Lantern.</p>

<p>“Can you show me the way to the Wishing-Gate?”
said Blunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly, with pleasure,” answered Jack, and,
catching up his lantern, set out at once.</p>

<p>Blunder followed close, but, in watching the lantern,
he forgot to look to his feet, and fell into a
hole filled with black mud.</p>

<p>“I say! the Wishing-Gate is not down there,”
called out Jack, whisking off among the tree-tops.</p>

<p>“But I can’t come up there,” whimpered Blunder.</p>

<p>“That is not my fault, then,” answered Jack,
merrily, dancing out of sight.</p>

<p>Oh, a very angry little boy was Blunder, when he
clambered out of the hole. “I don’t know where
it is,” he said, crying; “I can’t find it, and I’ll go
straight home.”</p>

<p>Just then he stepped on an old, moss-grown,
rotten stump; and it happening, unluckily, that this
rotten stump was a wood-goblin’s chimney, Blunder
fell through, headlong, in among the pots and pans
in which the goblin’s cook was cooking the goblin’s
supper. The old goblin, who was asleep upstairs,
started up in a fright at the tremendous clash and
clatter, and, finding that his house was tumbling
about his ears, as he thought at first, stumped down
to the kitchen to see what was the matter. The cook
heard him coming, and looked about her in a fright
to hide Blunder.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried she. “If my master catches
you, he will have you in a pie. In the next room<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
stands a pair of shoes. Jump into them, and they
will take you up the chimney.”</p>

<p>Off flew Blunder, burst open the door, and tore
frantically about the room, in one corner of which
stood the shoes; but of course he could not see
them, because he was not in the habit of using his
eyes. “I can’t find them! Oh, I can’t find them!”
sobbed poor little Blunder, running back to the
cook.</p>

<p>“Run into the closet,” said the cook.</p>

<p>Blunder made a dash at the window, but—“I
don’t know where it is,” he called out.</p>

<p>Clump! clump! That was the goblin, halfway
down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Mercy me!” exclaimed cook. “He is coming.
The boy will be eaten in spite of me. Jump into
the meal-chest.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it,” squeaked Blunder, rushing
towards the fireplace. “Where is it?”</p>

<p>Clump! clump! That was the goblin at the foot
of the stairs, and coming towards the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“There is an invisible cloak hanging on that peg.
Get into that,” cried cook, quite beside herself.</p>

<p>But Blunder could no more see the cloak than he
could see the shoes, the closet, and the meal-chest;
and no doubt the goblin, whose hand was on the
latch, would have found him prancing around the
kitchen, and crying out, “I can’t find it,” but, fortunately
for himself, Blunder caught his foot in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
invisible cloak, and tumbled down, pulling the cloak
over him. There he lay, hardly daring to breathe.</p>

<p>“What was all that noise about?” asked the
goblin gruffly, coming into the kitchen.</p>

<p>But as he could see nothing amiss, he went grumbling
upstairs again, while the shoes took Blunder
up chimney, and landed him in a meadow, safe
enough, but so miserable! He was cross, he was
disappointed, he was hungry. It was dark, he did
not know the way home, and, seeing an old stile, he
climbed up, and sat down on the top of it, for he
was too tired to stir. Just then came along the
South Wind, with his pockets crammed full of
showers, and, as he happened to be going Blunder’s
way, he took Blunder home. The boy was glad
enough of this, only he would have liked it better if
the Wind had not laughed all the way. For what
would you think, if you were walking along a road
with a fat old gentleman, who went chuckling to
himself, and slapping his knees, and poking himself,
till he was purple in the face, when he would
burst out in a great windy roar of laughter every
other minute?</p>

<p>“What are you laughing at?” asked Blunder, at
last.</p>

<p>“At two things that I saw in my travels,” answered
the Wind; “a hen, that died of starvation,
sitting on an empty peck-measure in front of
a bushel of grain; and a little boy who sat on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
top of the Wishing-Gate, and came home because
he could not find it.”</p>

<p>“What? what’s that?” cried Blunder; but just
then he found himself at home. There sat his godmother
by the fire, her mouse-skin cloak hung up
on a peg, and toeing off a spider’s silk stocking an
eighth of an inch long; and though everybody
cried, “What luck?” and, “Where is the Wishing-Gate?”
she sat mum.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where it is,” answered Blunder.
“I couldn’t find it;” and thereon told the story
of his troubles.</p>

<p>“Poor boy!” said his mother, kissing him, while
his sister ran to bring him some bread and
milk.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is all very fine,” cried his godmother,
pulling out her needles, and rolling up her ball of
silk; “but now hear my story. There was once a
little boy who must needs go to the Wishing-Gate,
and his godmother showed him the road as far as
the turn, and told him to ask the first owl he met
what to do then; but this little boy seldom used his
eyes, so he passed the first owl, and waked up the
wrong owl; so he passed the water-sprite, and
found only a frog; so he sat down under the pine-tree,
and never saw the crow; so he passed the
Dream-man, and ran after Jack-o’-Lantern; so he
tumbled into the goblin’s chimney, and couldn’t
find the shoes and the closet and the chest and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
cloak; and so he sat on the top of the Wishing-Gate
till the South Wind brought him home, and never
knew it. Ugh! Bah!” And away went the fairy
godmother up the chimney in such deep disgust that
she did not even stop for her mouse-skin cloak.</p>

<h3>THE GOLDEN PEARS</h3>

<p>There was once a poor peasant of Bürs who had
nothing in the world but three sons, and a pear-tree
that grew in front of his cottage. But the pears
were very fine, and the Kaiser was fond of the fruit,
so he said to his sons, one day, that he would send
the Kaiser a basket as a present. “Perhaps,” said
he, “if the fruit please him he may help me and
mine.”</p>

<p>He plaited a krattle, or basket, and lined it with
fresh leaves. Then he gathered the finest pears
from the tree, large ones as yellow as gold, and laid
them on the green leaves.</p>

<p>“Take these to the Kaiser,” said he to his eldest
son, “and see that thou dost not let anyone rob thee
of them by the way.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me, father,” said the boy, “I
know how to take care of my own. It isn’t much
anyone will get out of me by asking. I’ll have my
answer, I can tell you.” So he closed up the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
of the basket with fresh leaves and set out to take
the pears to the Kaiser.</p>

<p>It was autumn and the sun struck hot all through
the midday hours; so when the boy came at last to
a wayside fountain he stopped to drink and to rest
in its coolness. A little doubled-up old woman was
washing some rags at the fountain and singing a
ditty all out of tune. “A witch, I’ll be bound,”
said the boy to himself, “she’ll be trying to get
my pears, by hook or by crook, but I’ll be up to
her.”</p>

<p>“A fair day, my lad,” said the little old wife;
“that’s a weighty burden you have to carry. What
may it be with which you are so heavily laden?”</p>

<p>“A load of sweepings from the road, to see
whether I may turn a penny by it,” answered the
boy, shortly, to stop any further questioning.</p>

<p>“Road-sweepings,” repeated the hag, as if she
did not believe it. “Belike you don’t mean that?”</p>

<p>“But I <em>do</em> mean it,” retorted the boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well. You will find out when you get
to your journey’s end.” And she went on washing
and singing her ditty that was all out of tune.</p>

<p>“She means something,” said the boy to himself,
“that’s clear. But at all events my basket is safe.
I haven’t even let her look at the fruit with her
evil eye, so there’s no harm done.” But he felt
uneasy, and as he could not rest, he got up and went
on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>Soon he reached the palace, and on telling his
errand was admitted.</p>

<p>“You have brought me some pears, have you,
my boy?” said the Kaiser, well pleased; and his
mouth began to water for the luscious fruit.</p>

<p>“Yes, your Majesty, some of the finest golden
pears in your Majesty’s whole empire,” said the boy.</p>

<p>The Kaiser was delighted to hear this and he
himself removed the covering of leaves. But what
was his anger to find under it nothing but ill-smelling
sweepings from the road! The attendants, who
stood by, were equally indignant at the insult offered
to the emperor, and barely waited for his order to
hustle the boy off to prison.</p>

<p>“It is all due to that old hag by the fountain,”
said he to himself; “I thought she meant mischief
to me.” This was what he said the first day and the
second, but the quiet and solitude of the prison led
him to think more closely and to remember the
answer he had made to the old wife’s question.</p>

<p>“I have often heard my father say,” he thought,
“how strong truth makes the tongue. Alas, that
I did not use it as a weapon to take care of my own.”</p>

<p>Meantime the father said to his two sons, “You
see how well your elder brother has fared. He
kept his eyes wide awake and carried the krattle of
golden fruit in safety to the Kaiser, who was no
doubt so well pleased with it that he has kept the
boy near his person and made him a rich man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>“I am as clever as he,” said the second brother;
“give me a krattle of the pears and let me take them
to the Kaiser, and become a rich man too, only I
won’t keep it all for myself. I will send for you
to share it with me.”</p>

<p>“Well said, my son,” answered the father; “I
have worked hard for you all my life, and it is but
meet that in my old age you should share your good
fortune with me.” And as the season for pears had
just come around again, he plaited another krattle
and lined it with fresh green leaves and laid in it a
goodly heap of the golden fruit.</p>

<p>The second son took the basket and went his way,
even in better spirits than his elder brother, for he
had the supposed success of the first to give wings
to his feet. The autumn sun was as hot through the
midday as it had been the year before, so that when
he had traveled three days and arrived at the wayside
fountain, he too stopped to drink and rest in
its coolness. The doubled-up old woman was washing
her rags at the fountain and singing her ditty all
out of tune. She stopped her croaking as before,
to ask him the same question as she had asked his
brother.</p>

<p>“It’s pigs’ wash,” said he; “I am taking it to
see whether I may turn a penny by it.”</p>

<p>“Pigs’ wash,” repeated she, as if she did not believe
it. “Belike you don’t mean that?”</p>

<p>“But I do mean it,” retorted he, rudely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>And at this she made the same remark she had
made his brother.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when the Kaiser removed the leaves,
instead of golden pears there was a mess of pigs’
wash. The attendants hurried the second boy off to
the cell next his brother, and pitched him in with
even less ceremony.</p>

<p>Meantime the year was passing away and bringing
no tidings to the father of the good fortune
promised him by his son. “The ingratitude of
children is like a sharp sting,” said he, in the bitterness
of his grief and disappointment. He would
often say to his third son, who was considered too
stupid to be good for much, “What a pity it is that
you are so dull-headed! If I only dared trust you
I might send you to see what has befallen your
brothers.”</p>

<p>The lad was used to hear himself called a good-for-nothing,
so he did not think for a long time that
he might even attempt the task. But as the days
went by and his father’s distress grew more sore, his
loving heart was moved, and one day he summoned
courage to ask whether he might not try to find his
brothers.</p>

<p>“Do you really think you can keep yourself out
of harm’s way?” exclaimed the father, glad to find
the boy anxious to undertake the venture.</p>

<p>“I will do whatever you tell me,” said the lad,
eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>“Well, you sha’n’t go empty-handed, at all
events,” said the father. And as the pears were just
ripe again he laid the choicest of the year’s stock
in a krattle and sent him on his way.</p>

<p>The boy walked along, looking neither to right
nor left, but with his heart beating, lest he should
come across the “Harm” out of whose way he had
promised to keep himself. All went well, however,
except that the sun shone down on him fiercely, so
that when he too reached the wayside fountain he
was glad to stop to drink and rest in the
coolness.</p>

<p>The old wife was washing her rags in the water,
and as she patted the linen, singing a ditty all out
of tune. “Here comes a third of those surly dogs,
I declare,” she said to herself, as she saw him arrive
with another load of the magnificent pears. “I
suppose he’ll try to make game of me too as if I
didn’t know the sweet smell of ripe golden pears
from road-sweepings or pigs’ wash! a likely thing!
But I’m ready for him.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, little mother!” said the boy in
his direct way, doffing his cap as he had been taught,
although she was old and ugly.</p>

<p>“He’s sweeter behaved than the other louts, for
all he doesn’t look so bright-faced,” said the hag to
herself; and she stopped her song out of tune to
return his greeting.</p>

<p>“May I sit down here a bit, please, good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
mother?” asked the boy, for he was so simple that
he thought the fountain must belong to her.</p>

<p>“That you may, and take a draught of the cool
water, too,” she answered, wondrously softened by
his civil manners.</p>

<p>“And what may it be with which you are so laden,
my pretty boy?” she asked. “It should be a precious
burden to be worth carrying so far as you
appear to have come. What have you in your
krattle?”</p>

<p>“Precious indeed they are, I believe you,” said
the boy, “at least so you would think from the store
my father sets by them. They are truly golden
pears, and he says there are no finer grown in the
whole kingdom. I am taking them to the Kaiser,
who is fond of the fruit.”</p>

<p>“Only ripe pears and yet so heavy,” returned the
old wife; “one would say it is something heavier
than pears. But you’ll see when you come to your
journey’s end.”</p>

<p>The boy assured her they were nothing but pears;
and as one of his father’s commands had been not
to lose time by the way, he bade the old dame a courteous
farewell and continued on his way.</p>

<p>When the servants saw another peasant boy from
Bürs come to the palace with the story that he had
pears for the king, they said, “No, no! we’ve had
enough of that! You may turn around and go
back.” But the poor boy was so disappointed that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
he could not carry out his task that he sank down
on the step and sobbed bitterly, and there he remained
sobbing till the Kaiser came out.</p>

<p>The Kaiser’s little daughter was with her father.
When she saw the boy sobbing, she asked what ailed
him, and learned it was another boy from Bürs come
to insult the Kaiser with a basket of refuse. And the
servants asked her whether they should not take the
boy off to prison straightway. The Kaiser left the
question to his daughter.</p>

<p>“But I <em>have</em> pears,” sobbed the boy; “and my
father says there are no finer in the empire.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” jeered the servants, “we know that
by heart;” and they attempted to drag him away.</p>

<p>“But won’t you look at my pears first, fair princess?
The pears that I have brought all this way
for the Kaiser? My father will be so sorry.”</p>

<p>The princess was struck with the earnestness with
which he spoke, and decided to see the basket herself.
The moment she said so the boy walked straight up
to her with his krattle, so strong in the truth that he
felt no fear of the whole troop of lackeys.</p>

<p>The princess removed the leaves and—there indeed
were golden pears, not merely yellow with ripeness,
but really gold, each, large as it was, a shining
pear of solid gold!</p>

<p>“These <em>are</em> pears fit for a king,” she said, and
presented them to her father. The Kaiser was
greatly pleased. He ordered the gold fruit to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
placed in his cabinet of treasures, and to the boy,
as a reward, he promised whatever he should ask.</p>

<p>“All I wish is to find my two brothers, who hold
some high office in your Majesty’s court,” said the
boy.</p>

<p>“If those who came with pears before are your
brothers, as I suspect, they hold office in prison,”
said the Kaiser, and commanded that they be
brought. As soon as the two were led in, the third
ran to them and embraced them. Then the Kaiser
bade each tell his story.</p>

<p>“Strong indeed does truth make the tongue to
keep its own,” said the Kaiser, using almost the same
words the boys had often heard their father speak.
And they were truly sorry they had not kept his
counsel.</p>

<p>The Kaiser sent for the father and gave him and
his sons charge of the king’s gardens. The father
brought with him the pear-tree that, by the power
of the truth told of it, had made golden fortune for
them. And he and his sons had plenty ever after
and were well content.</p>

<h3>THE PUPPY’S BARK</h3>

<p>Our puppy is so little that he can hardly stand up.
But he wants the kitten to think him a big dog. So
the other day he steadied himself on his legs and
tried to give a loud bark. “Bow wow,” he said.
And down he tumbled.</p>

<h3>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WHITE KITTEN</h3>

<p>Once when a white kitten spied the tip of her tail,
she tried to catch it. Round and round she went so
fast that she turned into a white ball. But, of course,
the tail went as fast as she did, so she couldn’t catch
up with it. Soon she grew so dizzy that she had
to stop. There she was back again, a sensible white
kitten.</p>

<h3>A CONCEITED GRASSHOPPER</h3>

<p>The other day a very young grasshopper and an old
rooster were out in the field together.</p>

<p>“I can jump higher than anyone in this field,”
cried the grasshopper. The rooster said nothing,
but opened his mouth as if he meant to yawn.</p>

<p>“Here I go,” cried the grasshopper, and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
jumped so high that she landed in the rooster’s
mouth. The rooster gobbled her up.</p>

<p>And that was the end of her and her boasting.</p>

<h3>THE MOUSE’S ESCAPE</h3>

<p>A little gray mouse lived in a hole in our kitchen
closet. One day she smelled some cheese. “M-m,”
she said, “how delicious!” She peeped out to see
whether Tom, our cat, was in the kitchen. He
wasn’t. Out she stole, sniffed about, and found the
cheese. Just as she began to nibble it, along came
Tom. The little mouse darted back into her safe
hole.</p>

<h3>WHAT THE WHITE HEN DID FOR THE WORLD</h3>

<p>One morning the white hen went into the barn.
The rooster saw her go, but he didn’t stop her.
After a few minutes out she came, clucking to the
whole world, “Cut-cut-cut-cut-cadah-cut! Cut-cut-cut-cut-cadah-cut!”
And the whole world as well
as the rooster knew she had laid an egg.</p>

<h3>THE GOLDEN GOOSE</h3>

<p>Once a man owned a wonderful goose. Every
morning when he said, “Lay,” it laid a golden egg.
By and by the man grew so greedy that he wanted
all the golden eggs at once. So he cut open the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
goose. There wasn’t one egg in it. And, of course,
the goose couldn’t lay any more eggs now. The
foolish man had killed the goose that laid the golden
eggs.</p>

<h3>THE MOON AND HER MOTHER</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>This story may be accompanied by blackboard
sketches of the phases of the moon.</i>)</p>

<p>One day the moon asked her mother for a cloak
that would fit her well.</p>

<p>“How can I make a cloak that will fit you?” answered
the mother. “You are always changing your
size. One day you are a new moon. Another
day you are a full moon. And another day you
are neither.”</p>

<p>So the little moon has to go without a cloak.</p>

<h3>MOTHER CAREY’S CHICKENS</h3>

<p>One day in winter the snowflakes came down as soft
and light and white as feathers. The little children
looking out at the window sang,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>Down fell the snowflakes, thick and fast, and more
and more and more, till they made a snowstorm.</p>

<p>When they were all down the children brought
out their sleds, and away they went coasting on
Mother Carey’s chickens’ feathers.</p>

<h3>THE STORY OF THE WEE, WEE BONE</h3>

<p>Once a wee, wee girl came across a wee, wee dog
scratching a wee, wee hole to bury a wee, wee bone.
When the wee, wee dog had buried the wee, wee
bone, he trotted off on his wee, wee legs. And when
he had gone a wee, wee way, the wee, wee girl dug
her wee, wee fingers into the wee, wee hole, and took
away the wee, wee bone.</p>

<p>But the wee, wee dog smelled her out with his
wee, wee nose and said, “Give me back my wee,
wee bone; you can’t eat it and I can.” The wee,
wee girl wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Then the wee, wee dog sat up on his wee, wee
hind legs and cried a wee, wee tear. This made the
wee, wee girl sorry. So she gave the wee, wee dog
his wee, wee bone.</p>

<p>The wee, wee dog dried the wee, wee tear with
his wee, wee paw, and ate up the wee, wee bone.</p>

<p>And that’s the end of this wee, wee story.</p>

<h3>THE MISSING LAMB</h3>

<p>One evening a shepherd was turning away from the
fold when one of the sheep bleated mournfully.</p>

<p>“Is thy lamb missing, poor mother?” asked the
shepherd.</p>

<p>Just then he heard a loud bark, and there half a
field away was Carlo, his dog, guiding home a frightened
lamb. The little creature had strayed away
from her mother to find the very sweetest bits of
sheep sorrel.</p>

<p>“Bow wow, master,” called Carlo, “don’t close
up yet.”</p>

<p>“Ba-a-a, ba-a-a-a,” cried the little lamb, “dear
mother, where are you?”</p>

<p>The mother heard her and bounded into the air
with joy. “Ba-a-a, come to me, my lamb,” she
called, “come to me, my lambkin, my wee lambkin,
my wee wee little lamb.”</p>

<p>The little lamb leaped to her mother’s side and was
safe in the fold.</p>

<p>The shepherd patted Carlo on the head and called
him “Good dog” and said, “Come with me, my
dog, and I’ll give thee a bone thick with meat.”</p>

<h3>THE ANT AND THE DOVE</h3>

<p>Once an ant went to the bank of a river to quench
her thirst. As she stooped to the water she fell in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
and was nearly drowned. A dove perched on a tree
overhanging the river saw her and quickly dropped
down a leaf to her. The ant climbed up on the leaf
and it floated to the bank. She went ashore, safe and
sound.</p>

<p>Not long after this, a bird catcher stepped softly
up to the tree to set a snare to catch the dove. The
ant saw him and quickly stung him in the foot. The
bird catcher’s cry at the pain startled the dove.
Away she flew, safe and sound.</p>

<h3>THE BOY AND THE NUTS</h3>

<p>A boy put his hand into a jar to take some nuts. He
grasped so many that there was no room for his
hand to come out. In a great fright he burst into
tears.</p>

<p>“Be satisfied with half as many,” said a man who
was watching him, “and your hand will come out
easily.”</p>

<p>The greedy boy dropped half, and at once out
came his hand.</p>

<p class="right">—<span class="smcap">Æsop</span></p>

<h3>DID SHE CATCH HIM?</h3>

<p>One day a little girl said to her wisest aunt, “I wish
I could catch that sparrow.”</p>

<p>“The next time he comes,” said her wisest aunt,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
“shake some salt on his tail. But be sure not to let
him see nor hear you.”</p>

<p>The little girl went into the house and brought out
some salt. Pretty soon the sparrow alighted near
her. She tiptoed up behind him with the salt ready
in her hand. Nearer and nearer she stole.</p>

<p>Just as she stooped to shake the salt on his tail,
the sparrow cocked his head at her and flew away.</p>

<h3>THE BEARS AT PLAY</h3>

<p>A small brown bear and a small black bear walked
up to each other and rubbed noses.</p>

<p>“Will you play with me if I play with you?”
whispered the brown one to the other. And the
other whispered, “I will.”</p>

<p>The two trotted out to the center of the cage.
The brown one turned a somersault and the black
one turned a bigger somersault. After this they
both turned somersaults together.</p>

<p>When the play was over, they rubbed noses again
and each went back to his own cave in the rocks.</p>

<h3>HOW THE GROCER PLAYED A TRICK ON KIT</h3>

<p>Kit was the grocer’s horse. One day as the grocer
came up to her she whinnied and rubbed her nose
against his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha, I’ve caught you this time; it isn’t
in my pocket,” said the grocer; “here it is.” He
held out to her a ripe red apple he had been hiding
behind his back.</p>

<p>Kit didn’t wait to laugh at the joke; she ate the
apple in one big bite.</p>

<h3>THE SHORT TALE OF THE RABBITS WHO WENT OUT TO SEE THE WORLD</h3>

<p>Two white rabbits lived in a hutch in our back yard.
One sunny morning said One to the Other, “Let us
go out to see the world.”</p>

<p>So they did. They went up the alley way to the
front garden. Here the grass was growing fresh
and green.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the Other to One, “the world was
made for us. It is nothing but a big cabbage leaf.
Taste it.”</p>

<p>Just as they put their noses down to nibble a bit
of it, a dog poked <em>his</em> nose through the railing and
said, “Bow wow.”</p>

<p>“Oh my, the world belongs to him,” they cried;
“he may have it.”</p>

<p>And back they scurried to their safe hutch.</p>

<p>There they stayed, eating cabbage leaves and
letting the world alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<h3>THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE POT AND THE KETTLE</h3>

<p>The pot said the kettle was black. And the kettle
said the pot was black. And the pot said the kettle
was black. And the kettle said the pot was black.
And they kept it up.</p>

<p>In the middle of the dispute in came two servants.
One seized the pot and the other seized the kettle,
and they scrubbed them both within an inch of their
lives. So I suppose the servants thought both were
black. What do you think?</p>

<h3>HOW THE TURTLE GOT HIS DINNER</h3>

<p>It was the small black turtle’s dinner time. He
drew in his head and watched. A bluebottle buzzed
by, singing. Snap! out came the turtle’s head. The
bluebottle’s song was over, the turtle was eating him
for dinner.</p>

<p>“A bluebottle is a delicious morsel,” said the
turtle aloud to anyone who might happen to be
passing.</p>

<p>He dined that day on foolish bluebottles who
didn’t know he had a head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<h3>THE CATERPILLAR CAUGHT IN THE RAIN</h3>

<p>The other day a caterpillar was out walking on a
leaf, when it began to rain. He had no umbrella,
but that did not bother him. He crawled under the
leaf, and waited for the shower to be over.</p>

<p>When the rain-drops stopped pattering over his
head, he stuck out his head to see whether the sky
had cleared. It had. A beautiful rainbow was just
fading out of the sky.</p>

<p>Up the caterpillar climbed, dry and comfortable,
and went on with his walk.</p>

<h3>THE SONG THE COCKLE-SHELL SINGS</h3>

<p>One day Anna Lucy held a cockle-shell to her ear.
She listened and then began to smile.</p>

<p>“Do you hear anything?” asked her little brother
Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Anna Lucy, “you may hear it
too.” She held the shell to Frank’s ear. Frank
listened, then he began to smile. “What is it?”
he whispered.</p>

<p>“It is the song of the sea,” said Anna Lucy; “the
shell sings it in her heart.”</p>

<h3>THE WATER-SNAIL’S RIDE</h3>

<p>A little water-snail with his house on his back
floated on the top of the water. Suddenly he must
have thought of something downstairs that he
needed, for he drew himself into his house. Down
it went to the bottom of the water. The water-snail
stuck out his horns and head, and ate up a tiny
bit of seaweed. So I suppose that is what he needed.
In he drew himself again, and up went his house
just as if it were an elevator.</p>

<p>“You must find that house very convenient,” said
I to him. But he said nothing to me; he only floated
on the top of the water.</p>

<h3>IT TAKES TIME TO GROW</h3>

<p>A toadstool sprang up in a night. But it fell to
earth next day when the first passer-by touched it.
An acorn took a hundred years to grow into an oak.
But the oak is still standing, strong and tall.</p>

<h3>THE FRIGHT THEY HAD</h3>

<p>One day as a snail with his house on his back
crawled up a vine he met a ladybug. The two
stopped to chat about their children. All of a sudden
a little girl, who was passing, cried out,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ladybug, Ladybug, fly away home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your house is on fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your children all burned.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Home flew Ladybug, pale with fright.</p>

<p>“How thankful I am,” said the snail, “that I
carry my house on my back!” But on second
thought he too turned pale with fright. “Perhaps
my darling children will crawl near poor Ladybug’s
house to see the fire, and be burned to death.” He
turned about and crawled home as fast as his snail’s
pace would let him, and that wasn’t very fast.</p>

<p>But it was all a joke; it happened on April Fool’s
Day. The snail’s children were quite safe and so
were Ladybug’s.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, ha, Mr. Snail, you’re an April Fool,”
cried the little girl, skipping past again.</p>

<p>But I don’t know whether they understood her.
What do you think?</p>

<h3>HIMSELF</h3>

<p>“Who are you?” said Tom, to a small black shadow
beside him.</p>

<p>“Why, I’m you,” said the shadow; “don’t you
know me?”</p>

<p>“What, a little fellow like you!” cried Tom;
“you’re very much mistaken.” And away he
strode.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>“No, a big fellow like you,” said the shadow, as
he shot out in front of Tom.</p>

<h3>WHY THE CANARY SANG IN HIS CAGE</h3>

<p>A canary swung in his golden cage and sang joyously.
The window was open, so a lark heard him
as she rose into the air. She alighted on the window
sill in wonder.</p>

<p>“How can you sing shut up in a cage!” she exclaimed.
“Come out into the free air and up into
the sky with me.”</p>

<p>The canary stopped his song to listen to the lark.
“Why do you stop singing, little canary?” asked
a sick boy, in a feeble voice. He was in a bed near
the canary’s cage. The lark could not see him, but
she heard him. “Your song,” said the boy,
“makes me forget my pain.”</p>

<p>The canary burst into a sweeter song. “Now I
know,” said the lark, “he sings because it makes
the sick boy happy.” And she flew upward, wiser
than before.</p>

<h3>WHO THE BIRD WAS</h3>

<p>One hot day in July a bird perched at the very top
of a tall hemlock. The blazing sun shone on his
scarlet body and made it glow like fire.</p>

<p>“What a foolish bird to be out in the scorching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
sun,” cried Mother Robin to her husband. “He’ll
be sunstruck.” She and Father Robin stood shading
their eyes under the cool maple leaves to look up at
him. “Who can he be?”</p>

<p>“I think, my dear,” said Father Robin, “that I
had better go up and tell him to come down.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Mother Robin, “what would the birdlings
and I do if anything should happen to you!”
and she caught him by the tail just as he was flying
off.</p>

<p>As Father Robin opened his mouth to answer, the
scarlet bird spread shining black wings and flew
into the sunshine, singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I love the sun, the light, the flame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scarlet tanager is my name.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Never fear for him,” said Mother Robin, “the
sun and he are good friends.”</p>

<h3>HOW THE OLD TROUT SERVED TOM</h3>

<p>Once a water-baby named Tom swam close to some
little trout. He began tormenting them and trying
to catch them. They slipped through his fingers and
jumped dean out of the water in their fright.</p>

<p>As Tom chased them he swam near a dark pool
under an alder root. Out floushed a huge old brown
trout ten times as big as he. She ran straight at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
Tom and knocked nearly all the breath out of his
body.</p>

<p>So it was Tom’s turn to be frightened. After
that you may be sure he let the little trout alone.</p>

<h3>A CLEVER COW</h3>

<p>A quick-witted old cow learned how to shake
apples down from the trees. While rubbing herself
against the tree she noticed that an apple sometimes
fell. She rubbed a little harder, and more apples
fell. Soon the farmer had to keep an eye on her
to save his apples.</p>

<h3>THE SNOWMAN</h3>

<p>When the sun got up one morning in winter he
found a snowman staring at him rudely.</p>

<p>“Don’t stare at me. If you do you’ll melt,” said
the sun.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said the snowman. “A cat may
look at a king. I’ll look at you if I like.” And he
stared harder than ever.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he felt the top of his head softening.
“I feel very queer,” said he to himself. But he
didn’t stop staring. “Ugh!” he shivered, “water
is running down my back. My nose is going. My
toes are going. I’m going.”</p>

<p>And he went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<h3>THE RACE</h3>

<p>The kitten lay curled up in a ball fast asleep. The
pup was broad awake.</p>

<p>He stole up to kitty, lifted his paw, and gave
her a tap on the nose. Then he scampered off.
Up started kitty, and round and round the kitchen
went the pup with kitty after him.</p>

<p>It made the kitchen clock so dizzy to watch them
that she put up her long hand to steady her head.—“One,”
rang the bell inside of her.</p>

<p>“Time’s up,” cried the pup. And he and kitty
sat down on the mat side by side and the pup put
out his tongue and laughed at the fun.</p>

<h3>BRAVE DAN</h3>

<p>Everybody was out. So of course Dan, the pup,
was master of the house. He trotted proudly
through the halls and poked his nose into every
room, for burglars.</p>

<p>In his master’s room he heard something say,
“Tick, tick, tick, tick.” Dan pricked up his ears.
Somebody was in the house. Who could it be? A
glove lay on the floor near the mantel. Dan walked
over and began to sniff at it.</p>

<p>“One,” struck the clock on the mantelpiece.
Dan scampered off as fast as his legs could carry
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<h3>THE WIND’S FROLIC</h3>

<p>“Down you go,” cried the wind to the leaves one
morning in autumn. And down he blew them in
crowds from the trees, brown ones, red ones, and
yellow ones. Then he drove them scurrying before
him up the street. At last he swirled them together
in heaps, and left off to rest.</p>

<p>So there we too shall let them lie.</p>

<h3>THE DEAD CANARY</h3>

<p>The little yellow canary that used to sing so sweetly
grew sick and died. The children wept to see it.</p>

<p>“Let us bury him under the apple-tree,” said
Alice; “every spring it will cover his grave with
white blossoms.”</p>

<p>So Robert dug a small grave under the apple-tree,
and Alice laid the canary gently in it. They
covered him with the soft earth.</p>

<p>Every spring the apple-tree sent down his white
blossoms on the grave.</p>

<h3>THE SWAN’S MEAL</h3>

<p>One morning as a shining white swan sailed about
on the lake he saw a boy on the bank, eating some
bread. He swam over to the boy and thrust out his
long white neck toward the bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>“The beautiful swan wants my bread,” cried the
boy. He was delighted.</p>

<p>He broke it and threw it bit by bit on a lily pad.
The swan ate it, to the last crumb. Then he bent
his head as if to thank the boy, and sailed away.</p>

<h3>THE BOY AND THE FROGS</h3>

<p>Some boys at play near a pond began to pelt the
frogs with stones, just for the fun of seeing them
go under water. They killed several of them.</p>

<p>At last one of the frogs lifted his head high out
of the water, and cried out, “Pray stop, boys;
what is fun for you is death to us.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said one of the boys; “let us
leave the poor creatures in peace.” And they did.</p>

<h3>SWEET PORRIDGE</h3>

<p>There was a poor but good little girl who lived
alone with her mother. One day they no longer had
anything to eat. The child went out into the forest,
and there an old woman gave her a wonderful little
pot. When you said to it, “Cook, little pot, cook,”
it would cook good sweet porridge. And when you
said, “Stop, little pot, stop,” it would stop cooking.
The girl took the pot home to her mother, and they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
were no longer hungry, but ate sweet porridge
whenever they chose.</p>

<p>Once when the girl had gone out her mother said,
“Cook, little pot, cook.” The mother ate till she
was satisfied. But when she wanted the pot to stop
she found she did not know the word. So it went
on cooking and the porridge rose over the edge.
STILL it cooked on until the kitchen and the whole
house were full, and then the next house, and then
the whole street, as if it meant to feed the whole
world. No one could stop it.</p>

<p>At last when only one house remained the child
came home from the opposite direction and just
said, “Stop, little pot, stop,” and it stopped.</p>

<p>But whoever wished to come back to the town that
night had to eat his way back.</p>

<h3>FINDING A HOME</h3>

<p>Early in spring a couple of bluebirds set out to look
for a home.</p>

<p>“What do you think of this vacant dove-cote
for our nest, sweet wife?” asked he. “The
view from the top of the gable is beautiful.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid of all these windows,” said she,
peeping in at each. “The wind might prove too
strong for our little ones when they come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>“Parents must think of that,” said he. And on
they flew.</p>

<p>Under the eaves of a barn they found an empty
swallow’s nest. “The very thing for us,” they
both cried, and alighted to look at it. At this minute
who should arrive from the south but the swallow
who owned it? He saw at once what they were at
and flew straight into it, crying,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Kwi-kwi-kwivet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My house is not to let.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“How delightful to own a home of your own,”
said the she-bluebird.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” agreed the he-bluebird.</p>

<p>“Is that a wren’s house over there?” asked she,
flying over. But when she attempted to poke her
nose inside, out rushed two little wrens at her and
scolded her away.</p>

<p>“My love,” said he, “how you are trembling.
Let us build a house of our own.”</p>

<p>And that’s what they did. In a stump in an
open field they found exactly the hole they wanted
and there they made their nest.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before their little ones came and
found it the snuggest in the world.</p>

<h3>DID JIP DINE ON CHICKEN?</h3>

<p>One day a dog named Jip went for a walk. He
came to a yard where there was a hen with her brood
of chicks. Said Jip to himself, “A downy little
yellow chick would make a sweet dinner for a dog.
I think I’ll have it.” He turned in at the gate.
But Mother Hen had something to say about it.
“Cluck, cluck,” she cried to her chicks, and spread
out her wings to hide them. Then she lowered her
head, stuck out her sharp beak, and made straight
for Jip. He turned tail and fled home as fast as
his legs would carry him.</p>

<h3>THE DOG IN THE MANGER</h3>

<p>Once when some oxen went to their manger to eat
hay they found a small dog in it. The dog growled
and snapped at the oxen and would not let them
come near the hay. The stableman saw it all.
“Get out of there, you selfish cur!” he cried to the
dog. “You cannot eat the hay yourself and you
will not let those who can.” He seized a whip and
the dog was glad to run yelping away.</p>

<h3>THE TWO APPLES</h3>

<p>A real apple and a clay apple lay side by side. The
real apple was jealous of the clay apple. A little
girl had smoothed and pressed and patted the cheek
of the clay apple, but she had only looked at him.
Soon along came the little girl with her hat and
coat on. She picked up the real apple. “Come,
ripe red apple,” said she; “we’ll go visiting. I
know a little lame boy who will like a bite of you.
My clay apple would never do for that.”</p>

<p>As she looked at him, the real apple felt himself
turning a deeper red, he was so ashamed that he
had been jealous.</p>

<h3>THE DOG AND THE SHADOW</h3>

<p>A dog was crossing a stream of water, with a piece
of meat in his mouth. As he looked down, he
thought he saw another dog with a larger piece of
meat. Said the greedy fellow to himself, “I’ll have
that too.” He dropped his own meat and sprang
into the water after the shadow. The real meat fell
into the water and floated away.</p>

<h3>THE QUARREL</h3>

<p>One morning Tom’s right foot said to Tom’s left
foot, “Let me go first.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom’s left foot, “you let me go first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<p>“No,” said Tom’s right foot, “you let me go
first.”</p>

<p>And they began all over again.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom’s left ear remarked to Tom’s right
ear, “Perhaps, the silly things will set out together.”</p>

<p>“The very thing to do,” cried both feet, and they
started off. This left Tom without a leg to stand
on. So he fell down and bruised them both.</p>

<p>They were black and blue for three whole days.</p>

<h3>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WAX DOLL</h3>

<p>The wax doll went to visit the rag doll and sat in a
sunny window, where the people passing might
admire her.</p>

<p>“How handsome you are,” said the rag doll.
“I wish I had large blue eyes and red and white
cheeks. That white silk dress is very becoming.”</p>

<p>The wax doll only stared and smiled.</p>

<p>“Towser, the dog, leads me a life of it,” went
on the rag doll. She felt she must make conversation
for her guest. “Why,” said she, “the other
day he tore me almost to pieces, when—” She
stopped suddenly. Something dreadful was happening
to the wax doll. Her face was running down
on her white silk dress.</p>

<p>Just then in came the little girl who owned the
dolls. “Dear, dear me,” said she, “the wax doll
has melted,” and she threw her into a corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>“After all,” said the rag doll to herself, thoughtfully,
“I am not beautiful, and Towser troubles me,
but I have much to be thankful for.”</p>

<h3>THE ROUTING OF TOM</h3>

<p>One morning Tom met the geese on their way to
the pond, and for once the gander was not leading
them. Tom made sure of this. Gander had once
chased him half a mile for teasing the geese.</p>

<p>“I’ll be master instead of the gander,” said he
to the geese. “Shoo! back you go.” He spread
out his arms to drive them back. When they
turned to go, he ran around in front of them.
“Shoo! forward you go,” said he. Once more the
geese set off hopefully for the pond. “Shoo! back
you go,” cried Tom. So he kept the poor geese
running back and forth distracted.</p>

<p>At last one small goose plucked up her courage.
“Hiss-s-s-s-s,” she cried, stretching out her long
neck toward Tom. Instantly out went twenty necks
and twenty geese made for Tom, crying, “Hiss-ss-ss-ss.”
Tom took to his heels.</p>

<h3>MRS. VIXEN AND HER CUBS AT PLAY</h3>

<p>Under a rock lay a great brown, sharp-nosed creature,
with a white tip to her brush, and round her
four or five little cubs, the funniest fellows you ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
saw. It was Mrs. Vixen, a mother fox, and her
children.</p>

<p>The mother lay on her back, rolling about, and
stretching out her legs and head and tail in the
bright sunshine. The cubs jumped over her, and
ran around her, and nibbled her paws, and lugged
her about by the tail, and she enjoyed it mightily.</p>

<p>But one selfish little fellow put an end to all the
fun. He stole away from the rest to a dead crow
close by, and dragged it off to hide it, though it
was nearly as big as himself. His brothers caught
him at it and set off after him in full cry. Before
they knew it they were seen by a man. They left
the dead crow and ran back to tell their mother.</p>

<p>Up jumped Mrs. Vixen. She caught the smallest
one up in her mouth, and the rest toddled after her.
Soon she had them safe at home in a dark opening
in the rocks. But the fun was over for that day.</p>

<h3>THE FOOLISH HOOP</h3>

<p>“Why do you strike me and hold me in?” cried
the hoop to the stick.</p>

<p>“Shall I let you go?” asked the stick.</p>

<p>“Do,” said the hoop; “I do not need your
guidance.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the stick. And she let him go.
Down the street rolled the hoop. Fast and faster<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
he went. He could not stop himself. A turn in the
flags headed him straight toward the street. Out he
plunged under the wheels of a passing wagon, and
was crushed to pieces.</p>

<h3>HOW THE CLOCK CAME INTO THE STORY</h3>

<p>Once a little round-faced clock lived on the desk
of a man who wrote stories. The clock had a
chance to hear most of the stories. For when
the man finished a story he usually called a beautiful
lady into the room and read it to her. The beautiful
lady laughed at the fun in the story and the little
clock’s face shone. But perhaps that is what a clean
little clock’s face always does.</p>

<p>One day the man read from the story, “The
prince and the princess were married just as the
clock struck”—“One!” rang the little clock. Its
heart almost stopped beating; it had not meant to
interrupt the story.</p>

<p>The beautiful lady cried, “Why, the clock knows
the story.” But she laughed as she said it.</p>

<p>What do you think about it?</p>

<h3>BABY GOES ON A VOYAGE</h3>

<p>The other day baby went on a voyage on the good
ship <i>Hands and Knees</i>. She crept out into the hall
so softly that mother did not hear her go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>Out there was the cuckoo clock that said
“R-r-r-r-.” Baby stopped and looked up at it. A
door in the clock opened, and out came a little bird
who cried, “Cuck-oo, cuck-oo, cuck-oo.” In he
went again and the door shut.</p>

<p>Baby gurgled with glee. “I tee oo,” she cried.
She sat down to wait for the little bird to come out
and play again.</p>

<p>But mother found her, and carried her back on
the good ship <i>Mother’s Arms</i>.</p>

<h3>THE RUNAWAYS</h3>

<p>One day four little white pigs and three little white
geese met together near Rover’s kennel. But they
were so full of themselves that they did not notice
where they were.</p>

<p>“We stole out while Mother Sow was dozing
after dinner,” screamed the little pigs. They
laughed so much they rolled on the ground.</p>

<p>“We stole out while Mother Goose was gabbling
with a neighbor,” giggled the little geese. And
they hugged their sides to think how clever they
were.</p>

<p>“What’s this! what’s this!” growled Rover,
coming to the door of his kennel.</p>

<p>The pigs squealed with fright and the geese
clacked in terror. All took to their heels, back to
their mothers.</p>

<h3>THE NAIL</h3>

<p>A merchant had done good business at the fair;
he had sold his wares, and filled his bag with gold
and silver. Then he set out at once on his journey
home, for he wished to be in his own house before
night. He packed his bag with the money on his
horse, and rode away.</p>

<p>At noon he rested in a town; when he wanted to
go on, the stable-boy brought out his horse, and
said,—</p>

<p>“A nail is wanting, sir, in the shoe of its left
hind foot.”</p>

<p>“Let it be wanting,” answered the merchant;
“the shoe will stay on for the six miles I have still
to go. I am in a hurry.” In the afternoon, when
he once more got down and had his horse fed, the
stable-boy went into the room to him, and said,—</p>

<p>“Sir, a shoe is wanting from your horse’s left
hind foot. Shall I take him to the blacksmith?”</p>

<p>“Let it still be wanting,” said the man; “the
horse can very well hold out for a couple of miles
more. I am in a hurry.”</p>

<p>He rode forth, but before long the horse began to
limp. It had not limped long before it began to
stumble, and it had not stumbled long before it fell
down and broke its leg. The merchant had to leave
the horse where it was, and unstrap the bag, take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
it on his back, and go home on foot. And he did
not get there until quite late at night.</p>

<p>“That unlucky nail,” said he to himself, “has
made all this trouble.”</p>

<p>Make haste slowly.</p>

<h3>THE SOAP BUBBLES</h3>

<p>Anna Mary invited Dan, her dog, into the yard to
see her make soap bubbles. She blew out a beautiful
one shining with all the colors of the rainbow.</p>

<p>Dan watched it as it floated on the air. “What
can the lovely thing be?” thought he to himself.
It passed close to him. He put out his paw to touch
it. The delicate bubble was gone. There was nothing
but a wet spot on Dan’s inquisitive nose.</p>

<p>“Goosy Dan,” said Anna Mary, scolding him,
“lovely moons floating in the air are not to be
touched by clumsy paws.”</p>

<p>She blew the next one high above Dan’s head.</p>

<h3>THE PEACOCK’S TAIL</h3>

<p>The peacock pretended not to see anyone. He
strutted about picking up corn. But he must have
glanced out of the corner of his eye every time he
stooped for another kernel. For when a crowd had
gathered he left off eating and faced about in front
of the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>He swelled out his chest till he could not see his
ugly feet. Out he spread slowly his shining blue
and green tail with its hundreds of eyes. It came
up around his head like a gorgeous frame.</p>

<p>All the little boys and girls in the crowd held
their breath until it came out in a great “Ah!”
The peacock let them look a whole minute. Then
he lowered his tail and strutted away.</p>

<h3>HOW THE ROOSTER WAS DECEIVED</h3>

<p>The rooster with the reddest comb perched himself
up on the gate-post to crow. As he stretched his
neck he caught sight of another rooster higher up
on the barn.</p>

<p>“I’ll have no one in this barnyard higher than
I,” said he; “I am master here.” And he flew up
at the rooster. But his wings were so short that
he barely reached the edge of the roof. Had he
fallen he would have been disgraced before all the
fowls in the barnyard. He was so furious at the
thought that he rushed up the sloping roof and
pecked at the rooster savagely. The rooster never
budged.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha, silly cockscomb!” screamed Poll, the
parrot, shaking with laughter. “It serves you
right. Did you hurt your beak? He isn’t a live
rooster at all. He’s only a weathervane.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<h3>THE SHOES THAT WALKED MOST</h3>

<p>The cobbler sat at his bench. The shoes stood in
a row before him.</p>

<p>“Which shall I mend first?” thought he to
himself. “I know,” he said aloud; “I’ll begin
with whichever pair has walked most.”</p>

<p>At this out toddled baby’s shoes.</p>

<p>The cobbler laughed at them. “Why,” said he,
“baby has been in the world only two years at most.
You can’t have walked far yet.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the shoe for the right foot, “baby’s
mother says we never stop going until she takes us
off at night. We notice that grown people sit down
a great deal.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said the cobbler, “have your way.”
So he waxed his thread and sewed a patch on each
small sole.</p>

<h3>WHAT O’CLOCK?</h3>

<p>Mary and Anna Jane were playing in the fields.
Suddenly Mary stopped and said, “I wonder what
time it is. Mother said we should go home at four
o’clock.”</p>

<p>A dandelion spoke up politely. “My head will
tell you what o’clock it is,” said he. “Blow it off,
and, as you blow, count.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, sir,” said Anna Jane. Mary
was too much astonished to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>Anna Jane blew once. “One o’clock,” said she.</p>

<p>“Go on,” cried the dandelion. “My head is at
your service.”</p>

<p>Anna Jane went on blowing and counting.
“Two o’clock, three o’clock, four o’clock.” The
whole head was off.</p>

<p>“Thank you, dandelion,” said Anna Jane, although
she was not sure whether the dandelion
could hear without his head. “It’s time for us
to be going home.”</p>

<p>So Anna Jane and Mary went home at the right
time.</p>

<h3>THE WONDERFUL CHANGE</h3>

<p>It was time for the caterpillar to shut himself in
and prepare for a new life. So he chose a low
branch and began spinning his cocoon about him.
He made it firm and strong, so that no one should
break through it and disturb him. It wrapped
him about like a shroud. The caterpillar lay down
in it and waited.</p>

<p>Days passed and a new day came. The caterpillar
burst from the cocoon, changed most gloriously;
no longer a crawling worm, but a splendid
butterfly with wings. At first he tried his wings
timidly. Soon he spread them wide and flew up
into the sunshine.</p>

<p>Grown people as well as little children wondered
at the change, and felt joy in it.</p>

<h3>HOW NAN AND THE MOON WENT FOR A WALK</h3>

<p>One evening as Nan started out for a walk the
white moon in the sky went before her.</p>

<p>“Why, the moon is coming, too,” said Nan, and
she stood still, she was so surprised. The white
moon stood still too. Nan walked on faster. The
white moon went faster before her. At the corner
Nan turned to go home. Now the white moon was
behind, but it followed her even to the door. Nan
looked up at it before going in, and the white moon
looked down at Nan.</p>

<p>That night before she jumped into bed Nan
looked out of the window. There in the starry
sky was the moon gazing down at her.</p>

<p>“Were you waiting for me all this time, moon?”
asked Nan. “I can’t come out until to-morrow
night. We’ll have another walk then.”</p>

<p>And they did.</p>

<h3>WHAT CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS DID</h3>

<p>A great many years ago in far-off Italy lived Christopher
Columbus. He did a wonderful thing. He
and some companions and sailors set out in three
small ships to cross the great wide ocean. The
huge waves tossed the ships about and came up
over their bows. The sailors were so terrified they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
begged Columbus to turn back. But he was too
brave to do that. He kept on till he came to a new
country. It was America, our country. Then he
and all with him knelt on the shore and gave thanks
to God.</p>

<h3>WHAT THE MOON SAW</h3>

<p>“Yesterday,” said the Moon to me, “I looked
down into a small yard. There sat a clucking hen
with eleven chicks, and a pretty little girl was running
and jumping around them. The poor hen
didn’t know what to make of it. She screamed
and spread out her wings over her brood. The
noise brought the girl’s father out. He scolded his
daughter and sent her into the house. I glided on
and thought no more about it.</p>

<p>“But this evening, only a few minutes ago, I
looked down into the same yard. The hen and her
chicks had gone to roost. Everything was quiet.
Out came the little girl, crept to the hen-house,
pushed back the bolt, and slipped in. The hen and
chicks cried out at once and came fluttering down
from their perches. I saw it all, for I looked
through a hole in the hen-house wall. I was angry
with the obstinate child. And so was her father.
He came out and seized her by the arm.</p>

<p>“‘What are you about?’ he asked.</p>

<p>“The little girl wept and sobbed. ‘I wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
kiss the hen and beg her pardon for frightening her
yesterday, but she does not understand.”</p>

<p>“‘I do now,’ said her father. And he kissed
her on the forehead and on the mouth and on the
eyes. ‘You are my own sweet little daughter. The
hen will understand best if you let her alone.’”</p>

<h3>THE ELF WHO STAYED OUT TOO LATE</h3>

<p>In a beautiful rose there dwelt a little elf. With
a fairy microscope you could see his wings reaching
from his shoulders to his feet. Without it you
couldn’t see him at all.</p>

<p>One day when he went out into the sunshine to
play he had such fun that he forgot all about getting
home in time. He flew from flower to flower.
He danced on the wings of the passing butterfly.
Best of all, he measured how many steps it would
take to cross all the roads made of veins on the
geranium leaf.</p>

<p>It was this that delayed him so long. Before
he knew it the sun was down, dewdrops sprinkled
the leaf, and the night began to darken. The poor
little elf was very much frightened. He began to
shiver, too, with the cold. Indeed, he grew so
numb that he could hardly spread his wings to fly
back to the rosebush. But he managed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>The beautiful rose was just closing her petals for
the night. In he dived under the warm leaves.</p>

<h3>THE BOLD WEED</h3>

<p>The weed smelled rank to heaven. But she looked
out at everyone as bold as brass.</p>

<p>“Hold up your heads,” she cried to the violets.
“Push yourselves forward where people may see
you.”</p>

<p>But the violets held down their heads modestly.</p>

<p>Along came Lucy looking for some flowers.
“Ugh! what a rank smell that weed has!” she cried.
She plucked it up by the root and threw it on a
heap of rubbish. But she gathered a great bunch
of the dewy violets for her grandmother’s birthday.</p>

<h3>ODDS AND ENDS</h3>

<p>There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty
but very lazy and wasteful. When a little knot
came in the flax she was spinning, she at once pulled
out a whole heap of it and threw it away. Her
servant gathered up the bits of flax that had been
thrown away, cleaned them, spun them, and wove
them into a piece of fine linen. Out of this she
made herself a beautiful dress.</p>

<p>Well, the maiden was to be married. On the eve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
of the wedding the servant was dancing about in
the pretty dress she had made. The bride said to
the bridegroom, “How that girl jumps about
dressed in my odds and ends!” The bridegroom
asked the bride what she meant. Then she told him
that the servant was wearing a dress made of the
flax she had thrown away. When the bridegroom
heard that, he knew how lazy and wasteful she was.</p>

<p>“The other girl is the wife for me,” said he.
And he married the other girl in the very dress
she had made out of the odds and ends.</p>

<h3>ABRAHAM LINCOLN’S KINDNESS</h3>

<p>One day as Abraham Lincoln rode along on his
horse he saw a pig struggling to keep herself from
sinking into a deep place filled with mud. The poor
thing was squealing in terror, because the mud was
sucking her in.</p>

<p>At first Lincoln rode by without stopping. But
his kind heart could not forget the pig. He turned
back, got down from his horse, and drew the pig
out of the mud.</p>

<h3>THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER</h3>

<p>There was once a foolish little grasshopper that
spent all her time playing. Through the long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
summer and autumn she did nothing but sing from
morning till night. So when winter came and the
snow covered the ground, she hadn’t a morsel of
food stored away in her house.</p>

<p>Soon she was so faint with hunger that she
begged her neighbor, the ant, to give her something
to eat. “I am starving,” she said; “give me a
grain of wheat.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not save some grain at harvest
time?” asked the ant. “There was plenty to be
had. What were you doing?”</p>

<p>“I was singing,” answered the grasshopper.
“I had no time for work.”</p>

<p>“Hoity toity!” cried the ant; “if you sang all
summer you must dance hungry to bed in winter.”</p>

<h3>THE DONKEY AND THE MULE</h3>

<p>A donkey and a mule set out with their master on
a long journey. Each animal carried a load.</p>

<p>As he climbed the steep path up a mountain the
donkey felt his load heavier than he could bear.
He begged the mule to help him. “Help me,
brother,” he cried, “or I shall drop.” But the
mule pretended not to hear. After struggling along
a little farther the poor donkey fell dead.</p>

<p>The master now placed the donkey’s load on the
mule, giving him two loads to carry. And on top
of both he piled the donkey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>“It serves me right,” said the mule to himself;
“had I helped the donkey I should not now be carrying
his burden.”</p>

<h3>WHY THE MAGPIE’S NEST IS BADLY MADE</h3>

<p>Once on a time, when the world was very young,
the magpie was the only bird that did not know how
to build a nest. She told her trouble to the other
birds and they all met to teach her.</p>

<p>“Place that stick there,” said the blackbird. He
flew over and did it for her himself.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the magpie, “I knew that before.”</p>

<p>“Place this stick here,” said the thrush, placing
it for her.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the magpie, “I knew that before.”</p>

<p>The wren and the robin, the goldfinch and the
chaffinch, the lark and the swallow, and many other
birds went on showing her how to build the nest.
As each bit was added, she said, “Oh, I knew that
before.”</p>

<p>At last, when the nest was only half finished, the
birds lost patience with the conceited empty-head.</p>

<p>“Well, Mistress Mag,” cried they, flying away,
“as you know all about it, you may e’en finish the
nest yourself.”</p>

<p>That is the reason the magpie’s nest is so badly
made.</p>

<h3>HOW BUTTERFLIES CAME</h3>

<p>One day the flowers flew off their stalks high into
the air. They waved their leaves for wings. Because
they behaved themselves so well the fairies
let them fly again and again, and they no longer
had to sit still on their stalks and remain home from
morning till night. So by and by their leaves became
wings. The flowers had changed into butterflies,
red, yellow, and white.</p>

<h3>THE MONKEY DANCES</h3>

<p>The organ-grinder called out to the monkey seated
on his shoulder, “Dance for the children, Jacko,
and I will play.”</p>

<p>Jacko swung himself lightly to the sidewalk,
pulled off his velvet cap, and bowed low. Then he
put the cap on again, pressing it down firmly on his
head, and held out his little red skirt with his paws.
“Begin,” cried his master. And Jacko began to
step and turn and slide in time to the music.</p>

<p>The children clapped their hands. Faster and
faster went the music and faster and faster went
Jacko. At last he spun round and round until he
looked like a red top. The music stopped suddenly.
Jacko stood motionless on the very tip of his toes.
After this he pulled off his cap and bowed low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<p>“Bravo, Jacko,” cried the children, and each
threw a penny into his cap for food for himself
and his master.</p>

<h3>AN APRIL FOOL STORY</h3>

<p>One day all the rabbits were close together near a
back fence, sitting up on their haunches. The rabbit
in the middle was telling the others a story. It
was about a rabbit.</p>

<p>“So,” said he, going on with the story, “whenever
the little rabbit was hungry all he had to say
was</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Garden fairy, sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some lettuce I’d eat,’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And straightway a whole head of lettuce would
grow up before him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my,” cried all the rabbits together, “how
I wish that would happen to me!” And story-teller
and all turned a somersault at the very thought of
it. After this they sat up again to hear the rest
of the story.</p>

<p>But their pink eyes almost burst out of their
heads and their ears stood straight up toward the
sky. There in front of each was a large leaf of
lettuce.</p>

<p>“Why, the story’s coming true,” cried the story-teller,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
and he tasted the lettuce. “Yes,” said he,
“this is real lettuce.”</p>

<p>The others were sure of it. They were eating
theirs as fast as they could.</p>

<p>Now the dog, who kept the yard, hadn’t turned
a somersault, so he knew about it. He saw Fred,
hiding behind the fence, throw down the lettuce
leaves.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha,” he barked, “the silly things don’t
know that to-day is April Fool’s Day. Of course,”
said he, thoughtfully, “they have eaten juicy lettuce
leaves. That’s not foolish. Fred and I have
eaten nothing.”</p>

<p>“That story had a happy ending,” said the rabbits,
as they scampered off to play.</p>

<p class="tb">Which do you think was April-fooled?</p>

<h3>THE FOOLISH PUPPIES</h3>

<p>The biggest puppy said one day to the little puppies,
“Let us jump up on the table and enjoy ourselves.
There are plenty of bread-crumbs on it.
Our mistress has gone out to pay some visits.”</p>

<p>The little dogs said, “No, no, no, we will not
go. If our mistress should hear of it she would
beat us.”</p>

<p>“She will know nothing about it,” said the other;
“come on, the crumbs are fresh and sweet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>“Nay, nay, we must let them alone. We must
not go,” said the little pups again.</p>

<p>But the big one gave them no peace until at last
they went, and got up on the table, and ate up the
bread-crumbs with all their might.</p>

<p>While they were at it a shadow of someone passing
the window fell on the table. The big pup knew
what it meant. He jumped down and made off.
But the little pups were caught. Their mistress
seized a stick and whipped them out of the room.</p>

<p>Outside the little pups said to the big pup, “Dost,
dost, dost, dost thou see?”</p>

<p>But the mean cur gave them no satisfaction.
“Didn’t, didn’t, didn’t you expect it?” said he.</p>

<p>So they had to grin and bear it, and make up their
minds to be wiser the next time.</p>

<h3>A GOLDEN STORY</h3>

<p>There was once a buttercup shining in the green
grass. “You’re a little golden sun that turns
everything into gold,” said a child who saw it;
“perhaps you can tell a golden story.”</p>

<p>And would you believe it? The buttercup began
without waiting a single moment: “A certain old
grandmother sits out of doors every afternoon in
her chair. The hands resting in her lap are wrinkled
and so is her face, and her hair is as white as
the driven snow. All of a sudden two small<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
smooth hands steal round from the back of her
chair and cover her eyes. And grandmother immediately
says, ‘It’s my sweet grandchild; I’m
sure of it, because she never fails to visit me,’ and
she reaches up to touch a golden head.”</p>

<p>“Why, the story’s about me,” cried the little
girl; “grandmother’s guess is never wrong.”</p>

<p>But the buttercup went on without pretending to
hear. “Then the child runs around in front of
the chair and kisses her old grandmother. There
is gold in that kiss, I am certain,” said the buttercup,
“because it leaves a mark of itself on grandmother’s
face; it smoothes out the wrinkles and it
makes her eyes shine with joy.</p>

<p>“That’s my golden story,” said the buttercup;
“every child may go home and play it.”</p>

<p>And the little child was happy that what she did
had been put into a golden story.</p>

<h3>HOW THE CLOCKS PLAYED SCHOOL</h3>

<p>Three little clocks sat in a row on the mantelpiece.
The servant had put them there to wash their faces,
but they made believe they had come to school.
The tall grandfather clock from the hall was the
teacher. The servant had wheeled him in to sweep
behind him, but he too made believe he had come
to school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>“Be sure,”said Grandfather Clock to his
scholars, “that you tell the right time. Everyone
in the house looks to you for the time to get up,
the time to eat, the time to work, the time to play,
and the time to sleep. Is there any little clock here
who cannot tell time? All you have to do is to
move your hands around your face. When it is
time to strike the hour, be sure your large hand is at
twelve, and your small hand at the hour. It is very
easy.”</p>

<p>“Is it, indeed!” said the smallest clock; “how
about it when people forget to wind us up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried the other two little clocks,
“how about that?”</p>

<p>“Silence,” cried Grandfather Clock, sternly;
“that is a saucy way for little clocks to talk.”</p>

<p>At this moment the servant began to wheel
Grandfather Clock back into the hall.</p>

<p>“School is out,” he said.</p>

<p>So that was the end of it.</p>

<h3>HOW MOTHER TABBY PLAYED WITH HER KITTENS</h3>

<p>Once three small black kittens begged their mother
to play with them. Mother Tabby said nothing, but
gave her tail a sly wag to one side. The kittens
started back and looked at it. Mother Tabby
whisked it over to the other side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>“It is alive,” thought the kittens. They arched
their backs, and the smallest kitten put out his paw
to make it move again. Whack! went Mother
Tabby’s tail on his nose. The little kitten scampered
off.</p>

<p>But he was back again in a minute, and the fun
kept up until Mother Tabby walked off as if to say,
“It is time for little kittens to be in bed.”</p>

<h3>THE JOKE</h3>

<p>Last Hallowe’en a saucy red apple played a joke.
When little Tom ducked for him he bobbed backward
and forward so dizzily that little Tom lost his
balance and toppled into the tub. The saucy red
apple laughed as loudly as any apple can laugh.</p>

<p>But what was that he heard Tom’s big brother
saying? The big brother had pulled Tom out of
the water before you could say “Jack Robinson,”
and Tom was dripping wet and bawling with fright.
What did the saucy red apple hear? It was Tom’s
big brother saying, “Here, Tom, is a little red
apple for you.” And he handed the saucy red apple
to Tom.</p>

<p>The saucy red apple stopped laughing suddenly,
for he found himself between little Tom’s sharp
teeth.</p>

<p class="tb">So Tom had the best of the joke after all, hadn’t
he?</p>

<h3>THE SISTERS</h3>

<p>“You dirty black thing,” cried the diamond to the
coal, “do not come near me.”</p>

<p>“I will not indeed,” said the coal; “you are too
beautiful for the likes of me. I might dim your
brilliance.”</p>

<p>When she heard this answer, the proud diamond
was ashamed of herself. “Press close to me,” she
said, “you are my own sister. I am only more
highly polished.”</p>

<h3>THE LION AND THE SHEPHERD</h3>

<p>Once a lion roaming through the forest trod on a
thorn and it stuck in his foot. In great pain he
limped out to a shepherd and looked up at him beseechingly.
The shepherd gently drew out the
thorn. The lion fawned upon him and licked his
hand to thank him.</p>

<p>Not long after the shepherd was blamed for a
wrong he had not done. The king said he must
die. “Throw him to the lions and let him be
torn to pieces,” commanded the king.</p>

<p>The king’s officers seized the poor shepherd and
threw him into the arena, before the lion’s cage.
Out stalked a lion. It was the very one the shepherd
had helped. And lo! instead of tearing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
shepherd to pieces the noble beast fawned upon him
and licked his hand.</p>

<p>The king was amazed. He ordered the shepherd
to tell him what it all meant. When he heard he
let the shepherd go back to his sheep and the lion
back to the free forest.</p>

<h3>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BALLOON</h3>

<p>One night a gorgeous balloon when his candle was
lighted found himself beside a dull brown acorn.</p>

<p>“What a stupid dolt you are to stay here where
you cannot be seen!” he cried, as someone sent him
up into the air.</p>

<p>Higher and higher he mounted above the roofs
of the houses. “Perhaps he will reach the stars,”
said the acorn, gazing up after him.</p>

<p>Just then the balloon turned giddy with pride.
He reeled, caught fire, and his brief splendor was
over.</p>

<p>Years after, in the spot where the acorn had
lain that night, a great oak stood up toward heaven
and spread his branches wide over the earth.</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
